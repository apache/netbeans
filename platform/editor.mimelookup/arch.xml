<answer id="arch-what">
Each editor provides an EditorKit which controls the policy of specific MIME content type.
The policy of content type should be easily registered and found via some lookup mechanism,
that will provide convenient way of using it either for kit provider or base
editor infrastructure.  In addition to this, the policy can be inherited, (e.g. in case of embeded
kits like JSP) and the content types need to be merged in this case. MIME Lookup API should 
provide all mentioned requierements via easy lookup query, so content type policy 
user need not to solve this searching and merging on its own side.

It consists of

    <li><api name="MimeLookupSPI" group="java" type="export" category="official"/> in <code>org.netbeans.spi.editor.mimelookup</code></li>
</ul>

<p>API contains only two classes:</p>

1. org.netbeans.api.editor.mimelookup.MimeLookup with public methods:
<ul>
    <li> <code> static MimeLookup getMimeLookup(String mime) </code> - gets mime specific lookup. </li>
    <li> <code> static Lookup getLookup(MimePath mimePath) </code> - gets the lookup for the particular mime-path.</li>
    <li> <code> MimeLookup childLookup(String mime) </code> - gets mime specific child (embeded) lookup. The method was deprecated in favour of 
        static Lookup getLookup(MimePath mimePath) </li>
    <li> <code> Object lookup(Class clazz) </code> - Look up an object matching a given interface. </li>
    <li> <code> Result lookup(Lookup.Template template) </code> - The general lookup method. Callers can get list of all instances and classes
         that match the given <code>template</code> and attach a listener to
         this be notified about changes. </li>
</ul>
<br/>
2. org.netbeans.api.editor.mimelookup.MimePath with public methods:
<ul>
    <li> <code> static MimePath get(String mimeType) </code> - gets root mime-path for the given mime-type. </li>
    <li> <code> static MimePath get(MimePath prefix, String mimeType) </code> - gets mime-path corresponding to the mime-type used in the given context
      mime-path.</li>
    <li> <code> static MimePath parse(String path) </code> - parses the given mime-path string
      e.g. "text/x-jsp/text/x-java" and get the corresponding mime-path. </li>
    <li> <code> String getPath() </code> - gets string path represented by this mime-path. </li>
    <li> <code> int size() </code> -gets total number of mime-types in the mime-path. </li>
    <li> <code> String getMimeType(int index) </code> - gets mime type of this mime-path at the given index. </li>

      ranging from zero till the size of this mime-path. </li>
</ul>

<br/>
<code>MimeLookup</code> is represented via ProxyLookup that collects registered lookups. Particular lookups, 
responsible for looking up their objects can be registered using interface <code>MimeDataProvider</code> into default lookup
by META-INF/services registration. Previously used registration via interface <code> MimeLookupInitializer</code> was deprecated.<p/>
In addition to this basic registration, xml layer folder registration is also available. 
It is provided by registering implemented interface <code>Class2LayerFolder</code> into default lookup
 via META-INF/services registration.
This approach provides a mapping of class to specific subfolder. 
Using this mapping one can achieve the convenient way of using <code>MimeLookup</code> e.g.
<p>
<code>
    MimeLookup.getMimeLookup("text/x-java").lookup(FoldManagerFactory.class);
</code>
</p>
<p>
   Using this, an instance of FoldManagerFactory is retrieved from the folder with path 
   "Editors/text/x-java/FoldManager" provided that FoldManagerFactory.class is registered to
   a subfolder "FoldManager" via <code>Class2LayerFolder</code> registration.
</p>
<p/>
There <code>InstanceProvider</code> can be used if there are files
of various types in the layer folder that need additional handling
before becoming and instance of certain class.
For more details look at use case of PopupActions creation.

The Javadoc documentation can be generated by using
</p>
<pre>
    cd /cvs/editor/mimelookup
    ant javadoc

Unit tests are available.
<p/>
There are several testing areas covered:
<ul>
    <li> <code>MimeLookupTest.java</code>
    <ul>

After fixing the <a href="https://bz.apache.org/netbeans/show_bug.cgi?id=58941"> issue #58941 </a>
unit tests of template lookup should be added. All tests was rewritten and adjusted to newly introduced

            what circumstances? What kind of code would typically need to be written
            to use the module?
        </question>
-->
<answer id="arch-usecases">

<usecase id="per-mime-type-operation" name="Per mime-type operation">
Operation of the editor module must be parametrized by the type of the file
being edited. In the past the operation was parametrized by the class
of the editor kit but that did not show up as being useful enough.
<br/>
It is more practical to use a string-based parametrization concretely
the mime-type. Anyone can then easily register an additional functionality
for the editor because it's just enough to know the right mime-type and the type
of the functionality class to be implemented and the xml layer folder
where the class should be registered.
</usecase>

<usecase id="provide-lookup-result" name="Provide list of instances as lookup result">
On the modules' implementation side the registered functionality 
must be retrieved somehow. It's necessary to instantiate the registered objects
and react to module enabling/disabling which can affect validity of the registered objects.
<br/>
As the most convenient solution appears to use
<code>org.openide.util.Lookup</code> allowing to provide
the registered instances as a <code>Lookup.Result</code>
allowing to listen for changes (e.g. caused by the module enabling/disabling).
<br/>
This resulted into creation of <code>class MimeLookup extends Lookup</code> containing
<code>static MimeLookup getMimeLookup(String mimeType)</code>.
</usecase>

<usecase id="nested-mime-types" name="Nested mime-types">
On the lexical level the document can contain nested languages.
<br/>
For example JSP document can contain pieces of java code which can further contain
javadoc comment tokens with nested javadoc language.
<br/>
The nested languages should allow for special settings
such as fonts and colors of nested syntax coloring but even
things like actions that would be active in the nested document section.
<br/>
This resulted into creation of
<code>static Lookup getLookup(MimePath mimePath)</code> method in <code>MimeLookup</code>. 
</usecase>

API Use Cases
</b>
<hr/>

<usecase id="find-class-instances-for-mime-type" name="Find class instances for the given mime-type">

An API method
<p/>
<code>
MimeLookup lookup = MimeLookup.getMimeLookup("text/x-java");
</code>
<p/>
can be used for getting the mime specific lookup. Having this we can lookup class
 or template:
<p/>
<code>
    Object obj = lookup.lookup(LookedUpClass.class);
</code>
<p/>
or
<p/>
<code>
    Lookup.Result result = lookup.lookup(new Lookup.Template(LookedUpClass.class));
</code>
</usecase>

<usecase id="find-embedded-lookup" name="Getting embeded mime-type specific Lookup">
As an example a jsp scriptlet is used. Scriptlet in fact consists of parent "text/x-jsp" mime-type and
embeded "text/x-java" mime-type. To obtain a scriptlet lookup firstly we need to get a MimePath and then
get appropriate lookup:

<p/>
<pre>
    MimePath scriptletPath = MimePath.parse("text/x-jsp/text/x-java");
    Lookup lookup = MimeLookup.getLookup(scriptletPath);
</pre>

SPI Use Cases

<usecase id="mime-lookup-initializer" name="Providing implemented MimeLookupInitializer">
It is the general way of adding mime specific object into the <code>MimeLookup</code>. Implementation of <code>MimeLookupInitializer</code> should be created and
            registered to default lookup via <code>META-INF/services</code> registration.
For details, please look at the simplified 
<code>TestMimeLookupInitializer</code> 
            in <code>mimelookup/test/unit</code> or <code>LayerMimeLookupInitializer</code>.

                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures

                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex

Number of initialized MimeLookups. Since the <code>MimeLookup</code> delegates to ProxyLookup performance

Pluggins are just clients lookups that are installed into <code>MimeLookup</code>. The performance

provides a LazyLookup, it instantiates the object found in the layer only
