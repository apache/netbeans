 * This interface must be implemented by any class used as file-diff facility in assertFile functions.

 * is identical, they only differ by arguments types.
 *
 * Generally, they both take three parameters, the first two specify files being compared and the third
 * is the file, where comparision results are stored. Third paramtere can be null in case no additional
 * output except the return value is needed.
