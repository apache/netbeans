<usecase id="windowsystem-settings-for-topcomponent" name="How to create a '.settings' file for a TopComponent?" >

Either write it by hand (not that hard if you copy other file and
tweak it to match your TC), or start the IDE, instantiate the TC
somehow (You have a "Window->Show My TC", right? ),
copy the file that gets created in $userdir/config/Windows2Local/Component
and cleanup the serialdata section - replace it with proper  "&lt;instance class='..." /&gt; tag.

<usecase id="windowsystem-groups" name="How to make a TopComponentGroup?" >

<p></p>
    <b>Q:</b> I'm trying to make a TopComponentGroup.  I've just read https://netbeans.apache.org/projects/ui/ws/ws_spec#s39
            I want to make a group that uses the first invocation strategy.  
            That is, I want the group to open/close when I activate a certain subclass of TopComponent.  
            Say, for example, I have a FooTopComponent, and when it's active, 
            I want to open a FooPropertySheetComponent, docked in a mode on the right-hand side.
            I know I have to:

            <ol>
                <li>declare the group in the layer file (Windows2/Groups)</li>
                <li>have code for opening the group</li>
                <li>have code for closing the group</li>
            </ol>
            I think I do #2 in FooTopComponent.componentActivated() and #3 in 
            FooTopComponent.componentDeactivated().  Is that right? 

<p></p>
    <b>A:</b>Yes it is correct way. You can check
    <a href="http://source.apidesign.org/hg/netbeans/misc/file/tip/platform/samples/window-system-groups">simple test module</a>.
    First you must get TopComponentGroup instance using find method then call TopComponentGroup.open()/close(). 
    Here is the code in your componentDeactivated method:
    <pre>
   protected void componentDeactivated ()
   {
       // close window group containing propsheet, but only if we're
       // selecting a different kind of TC in the same mode
       boolean closeGroup = true;
       Mode curMode = WindowManager.getDefault().findMode(this);
       TopComponent selected = curMode.getSelectedTopComponent();
       if (selected != null &amp;&amp; selected instanceof FooTopComponent)
           closeGroup = false;
             if (closeGroup)
       {
           TopComponentGroup group = WindowManager.getDefault().findTopComponentGroup(TC_GROUP);
           if (group != null)
           {
               group.close();
           }
       }
   }

<!-- Question: compat-i18n

     <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.

<!-- Question: compat-standards

            Does the module implements or defines any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or it deviates somehow?

It follows JLF standard for the custom UI components provided by core implementation.

<!-- Question: compat-version

     <question id="compat-version">
            Does your module properly coexists with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read settings? Will future
            versions be able to read settings?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
Yes. Module stores its own versioned settings as XML files. In addition
components are stored in settings file format of core/settings module.

Yes. Component can control its persistence and way how they are displayed in container.

    Client property "KeepNonPersistentTCInModelWhenClosed" of TopComponent controls behavior of winsys

    to keep their position in winsys ie. be able to reopen at the same place and some TopComponent wants
    to be removed from winsys model.
    If property is not set nonpersistent TopComponent is removed from model when closed - it is original
    behavior before fix of issue #101700.
    If property is set (to Boolean.TRUE) then TopComponent is kept in model. It means that

The performance of window system can influence meny externals quite heavily. Cases which can singificantly
influence window system responsiveness are:
<ul>
<li>Long running client task performed in AWT thead</li>
<li>Any sublcass of <code>TopComponnet</code> with slow internal responsiveness, e.g. with slow
painting routines, validating, bad UI management etc.</li>
</ul>

Depends on number of displayed frames, components. Currently it is linear though
some part of components initialization is done only when necessary (eg. when component
is in JTabbedPane it is not necessary to initialize component ui when component
is not visible.
