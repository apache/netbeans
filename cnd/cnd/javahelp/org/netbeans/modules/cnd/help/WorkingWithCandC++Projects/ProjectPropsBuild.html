    <h2>
       C/C++ Project Properties Dialog Box: Build
    </h2>
    <p>
       The Build panel of the Project Properties dialog box lets you set the build tools properties
      for your project:
    </p>
    <p><b>Build host.</b> You can set the build host to the local host where the IDE is running, or a remote host
        that you have configured. Click the button next to this field to open
        a dialog for working with build hosts.</p>
    <p><b>Source.</b> Indicates how the IDE access the source files for a remote project.  You cannot change
    the value here because this property is associated with the Build Host.</p>
    <p><b>Tool collection.</b> Select the tool set that you want to use to compile the project. The tool
        collections are defined in the C/C++ panel of the Options dialog box.</p>
    <p> <b>Configuration Type.</b> The project has a configuration type that is determined
         when you create the project in the IDE. For unmanaged projects, which are
         projects from existing sources, the Configuration Type is Makefile. Projects created
         and managed in the IDE can be Applications, Dynamic Libraries, Static Libraries, or Qt
         implementations of these types.</p>
    <p><b>Enable Make Dependency Checking</b>. Select this option to enable automatic checking
        of file dependencies to make incremental rebuilds work correctly. If you change a header
        file that is included in some of your source files and then click Build, the IDE will
        rebuild only those parts of the project that really depend on the changed header.
        This feature saves time and leads to more consistent build results. Dependency checking
        is performed by the make utility through instructions in the Makefile.</p>
    <p><b>Rebuild if properties have changed.</b> By default, changing a project property does
    not trigger a build of a project. Select this option if you want the project to be
    rebuilt when any property is changed. With large projects that take a long time to build,
    you should not select this option to ensure that the project is built only when
    you build it. </p>
