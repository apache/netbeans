<!--
    abbreviation:  (String, required) Shortcut text that you type in
                   the editor to expand your code template.
    descriptionId: (String) A resource bundle key with description text for
                   this code template. Modules are encouraged to use this
                   instead of <description/> element to make their templates
                   localizable.
    contexts:      (String) The list of comma separated contexts for filtering
                   templates offered in code completion. Presently this is only
                   used by java module, which registers its own CodeTemplateFilter.Factory.
    uuid:          (String) An id that uniquely identifies this template. If you
                   provide one for your template make sure it is a real unique id.
    remove:        When 'true' this code template will be removed and all its
                   optional attributes and elements will be ignored.

    Contains the actual code of the code template. In API this is also called
    parametrized text. It should be raw text enclosed in <![CDATA[ ]]> section.
    No character translation is done when loading the code text (eg. pipe '|'
    characters are left alone). See editor/codetemplates module's documentation
    for the list of supported parameters (eg. ${cursor} for positioning the caret).

<!--
    Contains description for a code template in form of raw text enclosed in
    <![CDATA[ ]]> section. This is designed for users custom code templates or
