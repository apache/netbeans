# Enable the version 2 feature resolver, which avoids unifying features for targets that are not being built
#
# Critically this prevents dev-dependencies from enabling features even when not building a target that
# uses dev-dependencies, e.g. the library crate. This in turn ensures that we can catch invalid feature
# flag combinations that would otherwise only surface in dependent crates
#
# Reference - https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/features.html#feature-resolver-version-2
