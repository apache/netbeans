<h2>New C/C++ Project With Existing Sources Wizard: Code Assistance</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>The New C/C++ Project With Existing Sources wizard enables you to
create a project using an existing makefile.</p>
<p>In the Code Assistance page, you choose how your code will be parsed to
create the configuration used by the code assistance features of the IDE.
Code assistance is a set of IDE features that help you navigate and edit source code.
    See <a href="../EditingSourceFiles/EditingSourceFiles.html">About Editing C and C++ Source Files</a>
     for more about these features.
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Automatic Configuration.</b> If the project has been
built with debug information, the IDE searches for
the include files and macro definitions for each compiled source file.
<p><b>Build log.</b> This option is available only if you deselected
    Clean and Build after Finish in Step 3 Build Tool and you did not specify
    a Build Result in step 4 Build Actions in the wizard. </p>
<p>You can specify the path and file name of an existing build log
    that the IDE can use to gather information for code assistance. The log
must be from a full build rather than an incremental build.</p></li>
<li>
<b>Manual Configuration.</b> Lets you specify the location of include files and
add macro definitions to be used by the IDE to create the
configuration. The configuration will be for the entire project.
</li>
</ul>
