ERR_BadRestritedType=Bean class specifies @Typed annotation, and the value member \
specifies a class which does not correspond to a type in \
the unrestricted set of bean types of a bean. 
ERR_NonStaticInnerType=Non-static inner class cannot be managed bean or \
superclass of managed bean.
WARN_QualifiedElementExtension=The element is not managed bean: it has \
qualifiers but implements javax.enterprise.inject.spi.Extension.
WARN_QualifierAbstractClass=The element is not managed bean: it has \
qualifiers but has abstract modifier.
WARN_QualifierNoCtorClass=The element is not managed bean: it has \
qualifiers but does not have non-private constructor with no parameters or \
annotated with @Inject .
ERR_FinalScopedClass=Class is unproxyable: it has normal scope and declared final.
WARN_FinalScopedClassMethod=Final method is declared in class with normal scope.
ERR_DecoratorInterceptor=A managed bean cannot be annotated with both \
@Interceptor and @Decorator stereotypes.
 
ERR_DecoratorHasProducerField=A decorator may not declare producer field "{0}".
ERR_IntrerceptorHasProducerField=An interceptor may not declare producer field "{0}".
ERR_DecoratorHasProducerMethod=A decorator may not declare producer method "{0}".
ERR_DecoratorHasDisposerMethod=A decorator may not declare disposer method "{0}".
ERR_DecoratorHasObserverMethod=A decorator may not declare observer method "{0}".
ERR_InterceptorHasProducerMethod=An interceptor may not declare producer method "{0}".
ERR_InterceptorHasDisposerMethod=An interceptor may not declare disposer method "{0}".
ERR_InterceptorHasObserverMethod=An interceptor may not declare observer method "{0}".

ERR_InjectedCtor=A bean class should not have more than one constructor annotated @Inject.

ERR_SesssionBeanID=A bean class of a session bean should not be annotated \
@Interceptor or @Decorator.

ERR_InvalidSingletonBeanScope=A singleton bean must belong to either the \
@ApplicationScoped scope or to the @Dependent pseudo-scope. 

ERR_InvalidStatelessBeanScope=A stateless session bean must belong to the @Dependent pseudo-scope.

ERR_IncorrectDelegateCount=A decorator must have exactly one delegate injection point.

ERR_IcorrectScopeWithPublicField=A managed bean with a public field ("{0}") \
should not declares any scope other than @Dependent.  

ERR_IncorrectScopeForParameterizedBean=A managed bean with a parameterized bean \
class should not declares any scope other than @Dependent. 

ERR_FinalInterceptedBean=The bean class of a managed bean is final and declares \
or inherits a class level interceptor binding or a stereotype with interceptor bindings.

ERR_InterceptedBeanHasFinalMethod=The bean class of a managed bean has non-static, \
non-private, final method "{0}" and declares or inherits a class level interceptor \
binding or a stereotype with interceptor bindings.

ERR_NamedSpecializes=Bean declares name explicitly using @Named but it \
specializes another bean with name. 

ERR_BadSpecializesBeanType=Bean specializes another bean but it does not \
have all bean types of specialized bean. 

ERR_InvalidDuplicateIBindings=The set of interceptor bindings has two instances of {0} \
interceptor binding type and the instances have different values of some annotation member.

WARN_ScopedDecoratorInterceptor=The @Dependent scope is the only scope which \
interceptor or decorator could have. The non-portable behavior result otherwise.  

WARN_NamedInterceptorDecorator=An interceptor or decorator should not have a name. \
Otherwise non-portable behavior results. 

WARN_AlternativeInterceptorDecorator=An interceptor or decorator should not be alternative. \
Otherwise non-portable behavior results. 

WARN_SpecializesInterceptorDecorator=An interceptor or decorator should not \
have @Specializes annotation. Otherwise non-portable behavior results. 

ERR_NotPassivationSessionBean=Session bean has a passivating scope {0} and should be \
passivation capable. Stateless and singleton session beans are not passivation capable.
ERR_NotPassivationManagedBean=Bean has a passivating scope {0} and should be \
passivation capable. Passivation capable bean should be serializable.
