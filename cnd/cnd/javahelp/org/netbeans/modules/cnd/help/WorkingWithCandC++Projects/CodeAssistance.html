       Configuring Code Assistance For Projects with Existing Sources
    </h2>

    <p>
       For a C/C++ project with existing sources, you can specify how your code will be parsed to
      enable the code assistance features of the IDE.
    </p>
    <p>
       Code assistance is a set of IDE features that help you navigate and edit source code. See <a
      href="../EditingSourceFiles/EditingSourceFiles.html">About Editing C and C++ Source Files</a>
      for more about these features.
    </p>
    <p>
       The IDE can use several ways to gather information from a project to enable code assistance
      features. The build analyzer generally provides the most accurate information and is used by
      default. The IDE gathers information from the build by analyzing system library exec calls on
      Oracle Solaris, Linux, and Mac platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
       The build analyzer is used when you create a project with existing sources and whenever you
      build the project to automatically discover changed code assistance configuration. The build
      analyzer also runs if you manually run the Configure Code Assistance wizard.
    </p>
    <p>
       When the build analyzer is enabled, the IDE creates an exec log during the build and code
      assistance is configured using the exec log to gather information. When build analyzer is
      disabled code assistance is configured using the build log.
    </p>
    <p>
       For some projects you might not want to use the build analyzer, so you can disable it.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To enable and disable the build analyzer:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Right-click your project in the Projects window and choose Properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the Code Assistance category
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the Use Build Analyzer check box.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       <b>To start the Configure Code Assistance wizard do one of the following:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the Output window after building the project, click the Configure Code Assistance button
        in the left margin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right-click your project in the Projects window and choose Code Assistance &gt; Configure
        Code Assistance.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       When the project is parsed, the data is stored in the code assistance cache. Whenever you
      open a project, the IDE examines the cache and reparses the project if the cache is not up to
      date with the code. If the cache is up to date the IDE does not reparse the project and loads
      the data from the code assistance cache.
    </p>
    <p>
       If you later add files to a project, you should include the new files in code assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To include extra files in code assistance do one of the following:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In file properties,&nbsp;click the General node and select Add to Parse.
      </li>
      <li>
        In project properties, click the Code Assistance node and select Extra Source Files.
      </li>
    </ul>
