       C/C++ Project Properties Dialog Box: Code Assistance
    </h2>
    <p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp;</small>
    </p>
    <p>
       The Code Assistance properties panels enable you to set properties for projects created from
      existing sources and projects created from binary files, which are known as <i>unmanaged
      projects</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Note:</b> The properties here apply only to the configuration that is currently active,
      so be sure to select the appropriate option in the Configuration list at the top of the
      dialog box before you make changes.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Code Assistance panel
    </h3>
    <p>
       The main Code Assistance panel properties are:
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Use Build Analyzer.</b> This option is selected by default to enable the IDE to
      gather information from the build by analyzing system library exec calls on Oracle Solaris,
      Linux, and Mac platforms.
      See <a href="CodeAssistance.html">Configuring Code Assistance For Projects with Existing Sources</a>
      for more information about code assistance and the build analyzer.
    </p>
    <p>
       If LD_LIBRARY_PATH is unset in the build script, you should also unset LD_PRELOAD. When
      these two variables are unset, the build analyzer is automatically disabled. If you cannot
      modify the build script, you can disable the build analyzer, and the IDE can use the output
      log for build information.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Transient Macros.</b> Macros are specified as -D<i>macro-name</i> on the compiler command line and sometimes used to provide
      transient values such as time, date, or specific environment information. Such transient values
      should not be stored in project metadata for projects shared with other developers in a version
      control system. You can set dummy values for transient macros by specifying them here in the form
      macro=value macro2=value2 and so on. You must preserve the type of the value. For example, if you have
      macros called DATE set in "YYYY-MM-DD" format and TIME set in "HH:MM:SS" format, you could set dummy values as
      DATE="0000-00-00" TIME="00:00:00" for this property.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>User Environment Variables.</b> List of environment variables that are used in
      include strings to replace system specific paths. You can specify a list of environment
      variables to be used when storing project metadata. When the IDE stores the compiler options
      and an option value coincides with a variable value, a macro will be written instead. This
      prevents your system-specific information from being stored in the project files, which is
      useful for projects shared with other developers in a version control system.
    </p>
    <p>
       For example, if you have a variable ALT_BOOTDIR=/usr/jdk/latest, you can list the
      ALT_BOOTDIR variable here so the IDE can detect that when the -I/usr/jdk/latest/include
      option is used when compiling a file, it will store ${ALT_BOOTDIR}/include in the project
      metadata instead of the system-specific path.
    </p>
    <h4>Advanced options</h4>
    <p>The following options are shown if you expand the Advanced node.</p>
    <p><b>Extra Source Files.</b> Select this option if you want the IDE to include for code assistance
         all source files in the project regardless of the Excluded from Code Assistance check box value.
    </p>
    <p><b>Exclude Pattern.</b> You can specify folders in the source directory
that you do not want the IDE to use for code assistance. For example
use /test/ to ignore files in a test directory.
    </p>
     <p>
        <b>Resolve symbolic links.</b> If selected, and the build system uses symbolic links to source files,
        the IDE will add the original files to the project instead of the links.
      </p>
    <h3>
       C&nbsp;Compiler or C++&nbsp;Compiler panel
    </h3>
    <p>
       The C or C++ Compiler panel lets you set code assistance compiler options for your C or C++ projects.
       The options shown in the panel are dependent on the tool
      collection that is in effect. Changes you make apply only to the project configuration that
      is selected at the top of the dialog box.
    </p>
    <p>
       Selections in this dialog determine the compiler command options that will be used when the
      project is compiled. You can see the command line options that are in effect when you make
      selections in this dialog box by clicking the button next to the Additional Options field.
    </p>
    
    <p>
       <b>Include Directories.</b> Type the absolute or relative path to the
      directories containing headers for your project, or click the button to browse to the
      directories and add them. On the file browser dialog box, you can specify Absolute or
      Relative path. 
    </p>
      <p>
       <b>Include Headers.</b> Type the filename of the header file to include
       or click the button to browse to the file and add it. This option causes
       the compiler to treat the filename as if it appears in your source files as an #include 
       directive. 
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Preprocessor Definitions.</b> Add definitions for macros used by the project. Click the
      text field or the button to open the Preprocessor Definitions dialog box to add definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Preprocessor Undefined.</b> Add undefined macros used by the project. These
       are macros specified in the compiler command line with the -U option, to undefine a macro. Click the
      text field or the button to open the Preprocessor Undefined dialog box to add definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>C Standard.</b> Specifies whether project sources should be parsed as&nbsp;C89, 
       C99, or C11 code. When set to Default, use the compiler's default C standard. This setting is inherited from the project level to the folder level and file
      level, and can be overridden by changing the C&nbsp;Standard setting in the properties of a
      folder or file. 
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>C++ Standard.</b> Specifies whether project sources should be parsed as&nbsp;C++98 code
      or C++11 code. When set to Default, use the compiler's default C++ standard.
      This setting is inherited from the project level to the folder level and file
      level, and can be overridden by changing the C++&nbsp;Standard setting in the properties of a
      folder or file.
