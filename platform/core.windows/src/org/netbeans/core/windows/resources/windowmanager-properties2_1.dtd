     "width" gives absolute width of main window

     "height" gives absolute height of main window

     "relative-x" gives relative width of main window
     Either x or relative-x or centered-horizontally true must be specified.

     "relative-y" gives relative width of main window       
     Either y or relative-y or centered-vertically must be specified.

     "relative-width" gives relative width of main window
     Either width or relative-width must be specified.

     "relative-height" gives relative width of main window
     Either height or relative-height must be specified.

     "centered-horizontally" is true when main window is centered horizontally

     "centered-vertically" is true when main window is centered vertically

     "maximize-if-width-below" and

     "maximize-if-height-below" are optional,
     they specify limit on computed absolute width/height,
     IF min(screen.width, maximize-if-width-below) > main-window.width OR

     ENDIF 
     It is to avoid main window size bigger than screen size (width or height).

     "frame-state" represents state of frame.
     It is represented as bitwise mask - integer value.
     See java.awt.Frame for possible values.
     Default value is Frame.NORMAL (0).

     "orientation" sets orientation of splitter. "horizontal" means splitting
     along x axis - components are from left to right. "vertical" means splitting
     along y axis - components are from top to bottom.
     "number" sets number of cell in given split cell. It is integer number. Number defines
     position of given cell in array of cells. It is possible to define for example
     20 for first cell and 40 for second cell. Later it is possible to insert third cell between
     first and second by using 30 for third cell. It is usefull for platform to allow third party
     modules to modify (insert) their own modes to existing layout.
     Cells are counted from left to right in case of vertical split and
     from top to bottom in case of horizontal split.
     "weight" is double number from 0 to 1. It sets relative size of cell
     in given splitter. Default value is 0.5.
