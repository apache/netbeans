<h2>Setting Global Debugging Options</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small></p>
<p>You can set global debugging options that will persist for all of

</ol>
<p>You can set the following global debugging options:</p>
<p>Session:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Trace Pause Interval (in seconds).</b> Determines the time
interval between the execution of each line of code when tracing.</li>
<li><b>Finish Debug Session When Program Exits.</b> Determines
whether the debug session is automatically terminated when the
program being debugged finishes executing.</li>
<li><b>Auto Start Process After Program Was Loaded.</b> Determines
whether the loaded program begins running immediately.</li>
<li><b>Balloon Expression Evaluation.</b> Determines whether the balloon
expression evaluation feature is enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Window Properties:</p>
<ul><li><b>Front the IDE when current source tab is active.</b> Determines
whether the IDE window is brought to the front when the debugger sources tab is active.</li>

whether the Debugging window is brought to the front when a program is loaded.</li>
<li><b>Front The Program I/O Tab The First Time A Program Creates Output.</b>
Determines whether the Process I/O tab is brought to the front of
the Debugging window the first time a program creates output.</li>
<!-- <li><b>Front The dbx Commands Tab When The Program Stops.</b> Determines

when the program stops.</li>
-->
<li><b>Front The Access Errors Tab When An Error is Detected.</b> Determines
whether the Access Errors tab is brought to the front when a memory access
error is detected.</li>
<li><b>Front the Memory Usage Or Leaks Tab When a Report is Created.</b> Determines
whether the Memory Usage or Memory Leaks tab is
brought to the front when a memory usage report or memory leaks report is created.
<li><b>Open the Threads View When Loading In A Multithreaded Program.</b>
Determines whether the Threads tab is opened when a multithreaded
program is loaded.</li>
<li><b>Open the Sessions View When Loading a Second Session.</b> Determines
whether the Sessions tab is opened when a second debugging session
is started.</li>
<li><b>Maximum Lines Of Output For list Command.</b> Determines the
maximum number of lines of output for the dbx <tt>list</tt> command.</li>
<!-- <li><b>Save And Restore Breakpoints.</b> Determines whether 
breakpoints will be saved and restored in the next debugging session.
</li>
<li><b>Auto Start Process.</b> Determines whether a 
<tt>step</tt>, <tt>next</tt>, <tt>stepi</tt>, or <tt>nexti</tt> 
command starts a process that is in the "ready to run" state and
