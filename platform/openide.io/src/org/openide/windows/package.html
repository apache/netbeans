Interfaces for working with input/output tabs.

<p>A few other parts of NetBeans use the Output Window to display
messages from a running process or operation of some sort - for
example, the progress of compilation, or status messages from the
Java parser.

<p>The Output Window is organized into tabs, each of which is
capable of handling both input and output.

{@link IOProvider#getIO(java.lang.String,boolean) IOProvider.getIO(String, boolean) }

will get the

{@link InputOutput InputOutput }

handle for one tab of the output window. Frequently, though, such a
tab will be created by NetBeans implementation code and passed to your
code automatically.</p>
