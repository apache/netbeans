</head>
<body>
<h2>Folding Blocks of Code in C and C++ Files</h2>
<p>
For some types of files, you can use the code folding feature to collapse
blocks of code so that only the first line of the block displays in the Source
Editor.
</p>
<p>
A block of code that can be folded is indicated by a collapse icon
<img alt="Collapse icon minus sign" src="../images/cf_minus.gif">&nbsp;to the left of the first line of the block. A vertical line extends from the
collapse icon to the bottom of the foldable code. A block of code that is
already folded is indicated by an expand icon
<img alt="Expand icon plus sign" src="../images/cf_plus.gif">&nbsp;to left of the
code block. You can expand and collapse folds by clicking expand and collapse
icons or by right-clicking in the code itself and choosing from the Code Folds
pop-up menu.
</p>
<p>
You can mouse over the folded block to quickly display the code in the block.
</p>
<p>
For C and C++ files, you can fold:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Block comments at topmost level
</li>
<li>Several subsequent line comments at topmost level
</li>
<li>
All levels of function definitions
</li>
<li>Compound statements such as if-then, do-while, while, for, switch, and so on. </li>
<li>Preprocessor conditionals such as <tt>#ifdef</tt>, <tt>#if</tt>,
<tt>#else</tt>, and <tt>#endif</tt>
</li>
<li>All levels of classes, unions, structs, and enums
</li>
</ul>
