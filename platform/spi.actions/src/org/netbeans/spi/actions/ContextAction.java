/**
 * An action which operates in the global <i>selection context</i> (a
 * Lookup such as the return value of Utilities.actionsGlobalContext()).
 * Context actions are sensitive to the presence or absence of a particular
 * Java type in a Lookup.  The presence or absence of objects of that type
 * can changed based on things like what the user has selected, or what
 * logical window contains focus, or both of those things.
 * <p/>
 * Context actions implement <code>org.openide.util.ContextAwareAction</code>,
 * which has the method <code>createContextAwareInstance()</code> to create
 * an instance of the action for a specific context (for example, a popup
 * menu - the selection might change while the popup is on-screen, but what
 * the action in the popup menu operates on should not).
 * <p/>
 * Context actions make it possible to have a global action which doesn't
 * have to know anything in particular about which object going to operate on;
 * it just knows the type of that object.  When invoked, it acts on whatever
 * is selected at that moment in time.
 * <p/>
 * This class and its subclasses are a replacement for most uses of
 * NodeAction and CookieAction from the Nodes API.
 * In the NetBeans IDE, to declaratively install a global ContextAction, simply write
 * a static method that contains the above code, and reference it in your
 * layer file as the <code>methodvalue</code> for your <code>.instance</code>
 * or similar file.
 * <p/>
 * <h4>Using ContextAction in place of NodeAction or CookieAction</h4>
 * Replacing CookieAction with ContextAction is fairly straightforward.
 * <p/>
 * The most straightforward replacement for <code>CookieAction</code> is
 * <code>LookupProviderAction</code>.  It handles one layer of indirection -
 * that is, a <code>CookieAction</code> first needs to have at least one <code>Node</code>
 * selected;  a <code>Node</code> is itself a <code>Lookup.Provider</code>,
 * and so the <code>CookieAction</code>
 * is sensitive to some object type in the lookup of one or more selected
 * <code>Node</code>s.  So a <code>CookieAction</code> is an action sensitive
 * to an object (the cookie) in the lookup of an object in the selection (the node).
 * <p/>
 * <code>LookupProviderAction</code> accomplishes the same thing, without
 * requiring that the second <code>Lookup.Provider</code> be a <code>Node</code>.
 * <p>
 * CookieAction supported a number of different <i>mode</i>s
 * which determined its enablement, based on how many objects were in the
 * selection and if there were any lookups in the selection that did <i>not</i>
 * contain an instance of the type it was sensitive to.  In <code>LookupProviderAction</code>,
 * this distinction is split into its two constituents:  To disallow enablement
 * if there is some Lookup.Provider that does <i>not</i> contain the type you
 * care about, pass true to the superclass constructor for the <code>all</code>
 * parameter.  To control for the number of selected items, override
 * <code>checkQuantity(int)</code>.
 * <p/>
 * It is also possible with <code>ContextAction</code>s to do deeper indirection.
 * E.g., say the selection will contain a <code>Node</code>.  <code>Node</code>
 * implements <code>Lookup.Provider</code>.  You are interested in <code>Node</code>s
 * which have a <code>Project</code> in their lookup, and <code>Project</code>
 * is also a <code>Lookup.Provider</code> too.  What you really want to do is
 * write an action that is enabled
 * <ul><li>When the selection contains a <code>Node</code>
 *   <ul><li>which contains a <code>Project</code> in its lookup</code>
 *      <ul><li>which contains a <code>Foo</code> in its lookup</code>
 *      </ul</li>
 *   </ul></li>
 * </ul></li>
 * The only actually interesting logic here is what you will do with a
 * <code>Foo</code> if you can get hold of one.  Handling this is easy:
 * <pre>
 * ContextAction<Foo> theRealAction = new MyContextAction(); //this is what you wrote
 * Action<Node> theGlobalAction = createIndirectAction(Node.class,
 *   createIndirectAction(Project.class, theRealAction));
 * </pre>
 * If you had a CookieAction which was sensitive to more than one cookie type,
 * that scenario is not supported directly by ContextAction.  But what you
 * do instead will likely be simpler and more testable than your original
 * code, and will do the same thing:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Write one ContextAction subclass for each of the types you want to
 * support</li>
 * <li>Create your global action by calling 
 * <code>ContextAction.merge (actionOne, actionTwo, actionThree);
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <h4>A Note about Equality</h4>
 * ContextAction and any subclasses implement equals() and hashCode() such that
 * if the <em>type</em> of the passed object is the same, then the objects are treated
 * as identical.  This enables multi-selection to work.  This means that any
 * instance of a subclass of ContextAction is effectively a singleton and any
 * other instance of the same class may be substituted for it.
 * <p/>
 * If you want to create a single subclass of ContextAction which is passed
 * different parameters or create instances of the same subtype which
 * have different behaviors, you
 * are probably choosing the wrong parent class for your action.  The point
 * of ContextAction is that the entirety of the &quot;context&quot; is the
 * content of the Lookup that is passed to it.
 * <p/>
 * To, for example, change the display name depending on number of objects
 * selected, simply override <code>change()</code> to do that.
