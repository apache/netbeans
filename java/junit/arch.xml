        The module supports some aspects of JUnit-based testing.

<!--
        <question id="arch-usecases" when="init">
            Describe the main <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#usecase">
            use cases</a> of the new API. Who will use it at
            what circumstances and what will be the typical code to write
            to use the module.
        </question>
-->
 <answer id="arch-usecases">
     <p>
        The SPI allows to plug a project-type-specific implementation of JUnit
        support into NetBeans. The current NetBeans implementation only supports
        JUnit on J2SE project types. The SPI describes services provided by the
        custom JUnit support plugin.
     </p>
     <p>
        The functionality to be plugged in comprises:
     </p>
     <ul>
        <li>generation of test skeletons</li>
        <li>navigation between source classes and corresponding test
            classes</li>
     </ul>
     <p>
        For navigation, the plugin defines mapping between source classes and
        the corresponding test classes (both directions). Thus it provides
        an additional information to the information provides by
        <code>UnitTestForSourceQuery</code>
     </p>
     <p>
         For generation of test skeletons, the plugin actually defines the whole
         test skeleton generator - it generates one or more test files for
         a given source file.

            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>

            Can your module coexist with earlier and future

            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.

        <question id="exec-ant-tasks" when="impl">
            Do you define or register any ant tasks that other can use?
            
            <hint>
            If you provide an ant task that users can use, you need to be very
            careful about its syntax and behaviour, as it most likely forms an
	          API for end users and as there is a lot of end users, their reaction
            when such API gets broken can be pretty strong.

            Does your code grant additional rights to some other code?
            <hint>Avoid using a class loader that adds extra
            permissions to loaded code unless really necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by
            calling AccessController.doPrivileged().</hint>

            Does your functionality require modifications to the standard policy file?
            <hint>Your code might pass control to third-party code not
            coming from trusted domains. This could be code downloaded over the
            network or code coming from libraries that are not bundled
            with NetBeans. Which permissions need to be granted to which domains?</hint>

        <question id="resources-preferences" when="final">
            Does your module uses preferences via Preferences API? Does your module use NbPreferences or
            or regular JDK Preferences ? Does it read, write or both ? 
            Does it share preferences with other modules ? If so, then why ?
            <hint>
                You may use
                    &lt;api type="export" group="preferences"
                    name="preference node name" category="private"&gt;

                    influences, whether the module reads/write it, etc.
                    &lt;/api&gt;
                Due to XML ID restrictions, rather than /org/netbeans/modules/foo give the "name" as org.netbeans.modules.foo.
                Note that if you use NbPreferences this name will then be the same as the code name base of the module.

      <code>NbPreferences</code> is used, both for reading and writing.
