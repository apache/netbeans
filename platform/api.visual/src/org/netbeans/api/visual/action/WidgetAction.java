/**
 * This interface is defining an action that is usually assigned to a widget. The action is notified about all Swing events
 * related to the widget where the action is assigned.
 * <p>
 * Events: mouse, mouse-motion, mouse-wheel, drag'n'drop, focus, keyboard.
 * <p>
 * Each event handler has to return a state of the event processing (represented by WidgetAction.State).
 * <p>
 * Each Swing event is processed by all actions of all widgets in a scene. The processing can be stopped by consuming the event.
 * When processing event for a widget, then all children widget (from the last) of widget are asked for processing first.
 * Then finally the event is processed by all actions (from the first to the last) assigned to the widget.
