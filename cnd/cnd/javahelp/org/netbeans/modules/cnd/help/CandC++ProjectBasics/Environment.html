       Environment Dialog Box
    </h2>
    <p>
       The Environment dialog box lets you set runtime environment variables for your C or C++
      Application or Library project. To open the dialog box, right-click the project name in the
      Project window, and select Properties. Select the Run node, and click the browse button next
      to Environment. The dialog box is a table of empty Name and Value columns which are not
      editable at first.

        For each environment variable you want to set, click Add, select the Name text field and
        type the variable name. Select the Value text field and type the value.
      </li>
      <li>
        To remove an environment variable, select the variable and click Remove.
