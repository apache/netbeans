OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Extensible Abstract Model (XAM) is a framework for building logical domain-specific object models on top of any base models.\n\n\
    XAM has built-in support for XML W3 standard DOM syntax tree and is well-integrated with the underlying XML Document Model (XDM).  \
    This integration give XAM-based models the capabilities of efficient mutation with smart limitless undo-redo, lazy-loading all model components, automatic synchronization with source changes, document fidelity... \
    Other capabilities include internal and external reference resolving based on namespaces, as well as a framework to add schema-based and semantic validations.
