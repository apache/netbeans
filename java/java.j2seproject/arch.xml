   Provides a project type for plain Java projects. J2SE projects can be created
   from scratch, or you can import existing Java source trees. Creates an Ant
   script letting you build the project (and subprojects), run it, debug it, run
   JUnit-format tests, and build Javadoc. GUI customizer permits easy
   customization of the most commonly needed project parameters. Provides code
   completion and other services for editing Java sources. Classpaths can include
   other projects, raw JARs, or configured libraries. Specific J2SE platforms may
   be configured.

            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number

                If your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
