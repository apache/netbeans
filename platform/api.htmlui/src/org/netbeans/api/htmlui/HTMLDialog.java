/** Generates method that opens an HTML based modal dialog. Sample of a typical
 * usage follows.
 * <h5>HTML Page <small>dialog.html</small></h5>
 * <p>
 * {@snippet file="org/netbeans/api/htmlui/dialog.html" region="org.netbeans.api.htmlui.dialog.html"}
 * The <code>dialog.html</code> page defines two buttons as <em>hidden</em> - 
 * they are re-rendered by the embedding "chrome" (for example as Swing buttons),
 * but they can be enabled/disabled. For example the <code>ok</code> property
 * (defined in the Java model below) connects the state of the checkbox and
 * the <em>Good</em> button.
 * 
 * <h5>Java Source <small>AskQuestion.java</small></h5>
 * {@snippet file="org/netbeans/api/htmlui/AskQuestion.java" region="ask"}
 * <p>
 * The method is generated into <code>AskPages</code> class (specified in the
 * {@code className} attribute)
 * in the same package and has the same name,
 * and parameters as the method annotated by the {@code HTMLDialog} annotation. 
 * <p>
 * When the method {@code AskPages.showHelloWorld(true)}
 * is invoked, it opens a dialog, loads an HTML page {@code dialog.html}
 * into it. When the page is
 * loaded, it calls back the method {@code AskQuestion.showHelloWorld}
 * and passes it
 * its own arguments. The method is supposed to make the page live, preferably
 * by using {@link net.java.html.json.Model} generated class and calling
 * <code>applyBindings()</code> on it. The method is suggested to return
 * an instance of {@link OnSubmit} callback to be notified about user pressing
 * one of the dialog buttons.
 * <p>
 * The HTML page may contain hidden <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements. If it does so,
 * those buttons are copied to the dialog frame and displayed underneath the page.
 * Their enabled/disabled state reflects the state of the buttons in the page.
 * When one of the buttons is selected a callback to {@link OnSubmit} instance
 * is made. If it returns {@code true}, the dialog closes otherwise its closing
 * is prevented. A {@code null} 'id' signals user closing or cancelling the dialog.
 * <p>
 * By default, if the HTML defines no hidden
 * <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements, two buttons are added. One representing
 * the <em>OK</em> choice (with <code>id="OK"</code>) and one representing
 * the cancel choice (with <code>null</code> id). Both buttons are always
 * enabled. One can check the callback 'id'
 * to be <code>"OK"</code> to know whether the user approved the dialog.
