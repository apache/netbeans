        <h2>GSF Embedding</h2>
        <p>
            GSF supports language embedding - supporting nested languages, like
            JavaScript and CSS support inside HTML files, Ruby support (and JavaScript
            and CSS support) inside ERb/RHTML files, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the lexical level, the Lexer API already supports embedding;
            you can nest languages to an arbitrarily deep level. GSF adds this to other features
            based on parsing. This is achieved through two mechanisms:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Language plugins can register
                    <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/EmbeddingModel.html">EmbeddingModel</a> implementations
                    which describe how to generate a "virtual source" for a given destination language
                    from a given source language. For example, there is an embedding model which
                    expresses the JavaScript virtual source corresponding to a given JSP file. 
                    It's this virtual source that is parsed by the JavaScript parser.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All GSF language plugins need to be well aware that the source they parse
                    may not be the same as the document in the editor, and in particular, they
                    must ALWAYS translate offsets from AST offsets to Lexical offsets before
                    attempting to look at the document contents, and vice versa.
                    This is made easy because the embedding model provides conversion methods
                    which take one offset type and provide the other.
                </li>    
            </ol>
            This document explains the concept of virtual sources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Say you have this source RHTML file.
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="javascripts/effects.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;style&gt;body { background: red }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;script&gt;var x = &lt;% foo() %&gt;;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
function f() { alert(x.toString()); }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" onclick="f()"/&gt;
            </pre>
            In GSF, you will involve several source models here. It will create a separate "virtual source" for each of these
            languages: CSS, JavaScript, Ruby.
        </p>
        <p>
            The JavaScript virtual source (which is passed to the JavaScript parser) looks something like this:
            
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
__netbeans_import__('javascripts/effects.js');
var x = __UNDEFINED__;
function f() { alert(x.toString()); }
;function(){
f()
}
            </pre>
            The virtual source translator from RHTML to JavaScript replaced the server call &lt;% foo %&gt; with __UNDEFINED, and the
            onclick handlers have been translated into anonymous functions (such that writing "return this" etc. in an event handler
            makes sense from an ast perspective, you can only return inside functions).
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, the Ruby embedding model (RHTML to Ruby) will create this:
            
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
class ActionView::Base
_buf='';;_buf &lt;&lt; '&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="javascripts/effects.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;style&gt;body { background: red }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;script&gt;var x = ';
foo() ;_buf &lt;&lt; ';&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
function f() { alert(x.toString()); }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" onclick="f()"/&gt;
';
end
            </pre>
            In both cases, some of the code is coming from the original source, some is generated (e.g. the class <code>ActionView::Base</code>
            part above, and the <code>netbeans_import</code> to record JavaScript file inclusion and functions to contain event handlers). Some
            source is removed - typically embedded source that isn't relevant for this language -- such as all the markup.
        </p>
        <p>
            These blocks of code are maintained by each embedding model, which has a set of code blocks with corresponding offsets
            in the generated source and in the original source.  You get a map like this:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
codeBlocks=
CodeBlockData[
 RHTML(0,0)="",
 RUBY(0,31)="class ActionView::Base
_buf='';"], 

CodeBlockData[
 RHTML(0,130)="&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="javascripts/effects.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;style&gt;body { background: red }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;script&gt;var x = ",
 RUBY(31,174)=";_buf &lt;&lt; '&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="javascripts/effects.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;style&gt;body { background: red }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;script&gt;var x = ';
"], 

CodeBlockData[
 RHTML(132,139)=" foo() ",
 RUBY(174,181)=" foo() "], 
 
CodeBlockData[
 RHTML(141,266)=";&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
function f() { alert(x.toString()); }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" onclick="f()"/&gt;

",
 RUBY(181,319)=";_buf &lt;&lt; ';&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
function f() { alert(x.toString()); }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" onclick="f()"/&gt;

';
"]
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            In GSF, a virtual source translator can return a collection of models which is used when you don't create a single
            "synthesized" model like we do here - e.g. the multiple &lt;script&gt; blocks in JavaScript get merged into one. For CSS, the
            theory is that each style="foo:bar" block would generate its own model - these are all completely independent and don't
            have to (and shouldn't) be parsed together. Thus, for CSS you get a series of models, but there is a special method
            which returns the specific virtual source corresponding to a given offset.
