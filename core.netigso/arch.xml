            What other NetBeans projects and modules does this one depend on?
            <hint>
            Depending on other NetBeans projects influnces the ability of
            users of your work to customize their own branded version of
            NetBeans by enabling and disabling some modules. Too
            much dependencies restrict this kind of customization. If that
            is your case, then you may want to split your functionality into
            pieces of autoload, eager and regular modules which can be
            enabled independently. Usually the answer to this question
            is generated from your <code>project.xml</code> file, but
            if it is not guessed correctly, you can suppress it by

            <hint>
            Depending on 3rd party libraries is always problematic,
            especially if they are not open source, as that complicates
            the licensing scheme of NetBeans. Please enumerate your

            some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org/">libraries</a>) and

       List of registered OSGi bundles as well as mapping of their packages
       to individual bundles is stored in <code>var/cache/netigso-bundles</code>.
       This file works in orchestration with content of <code>var/cache/netigso</code>
       directory where the OSGi framework usually stores its own information
       about bundles.
       </p>

       The content of the cache file is <em>private</em>, but the location 
       is well known (including its relation with <code>netigso</code> directory),

        <question id="security-grant" when="final">
            Does your code grant additional rights to some other code?
            <hint>Avoid using a class loader that adds extra
            permissions to loaded code unless really necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by
            calling AccessController.doPrivileged().</hint>

<!--
        <question id="security-policy" when="final">
            Does your functionality require modifications to the standard policy file?
            <hint>Your code might pass control to third-party code not
            coming from trusted domains. This could be code downloaded over the
            network or code coming from libraries that are not bundled
            with NetBeans. Which permissions need to be granted to which domains?</hint>
