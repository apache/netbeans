            what problem it should solve, provide links to documentation, 
            specifications, etc.

    <answer id="arch-what">
	The tab control is a swing control used by NetBeans window system, similar in function to a JTabbedPane, which
        allows the user to see and select tabs that contain different components.  It defines two GUI components:
        TabbedContainer (similar to JTabbedPane) and TabDisplayer, a generic component for displaying tabs which 
        is not associated with any particular container.  Several different types of UIs (view, editor, sliding)
        are provided, each of which is handled by a different UI delegate class; UI delegate subclasses designed
        to fit with Windows, Metal, Aqua and GTK look and feels are provided.

        <api name="TabbedContainerAPI" type="export" category="friend" url="@TOP@/org/netbeans/swing/tabcontrol/TabbedContainer.html" group="java"/><br/>
        <api name="PopupSwitcherAPI" type="export" category="friend" url="@TOP@/org/netbeans/swing/popupswitcher/package-summary.html" group="java">
          API contains classes used only by <em>switchers</em> accessible through main menu in "Window/Documents..."
          and "Go To/Recent Document". Besides this module the package is used from core/windows too.
          Classes contained in the package are rather
          general and therefore this package could be moved in the future. It is placed here only due to current
          modules dependencies. Consequently the package is not intended for external use.<br/> For more
          information on <code>SwitcherTable</code> and <code>SwitcherTableItem</code> see a javadoc.

        <question id="compat-version">
            Can your module coexist with earlier and future

            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.

            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used

    <answer id="deploy-packages">
        No.  There are three relevant packages - API for the tab control and tab displayer control,
        an &quot;event&quot; package for logical separation, and a third package which provides an SPI
        for alternate UI delegate implementation (however unlikely it is that a look and feel author
        will take the time to write a custom UI delegate for NetBeans windowing system).

            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an
            API as well.

    <answer id="exec-component">
        There is an &quot;orientation&quot; property which is honored by one of the three
        UI types to display tabs on the sides or bottom of the container.  It is a client
        property, since it is optional for the UI delegate to implement this functionality

	No.  Different GUI types have different scalability characterisitics, in

        scalable (but the ui design for view tabs also doesn't scale - all tabs
        are displayed in a row and clipped if they don't fit); sliding tabs,
        actually create one JButton per tab, making them the least scalable.

        <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resources provided by other modules in
            their layers?
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and clasify according to 
            <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/wiki/API_Design#categories">
            common stability categories</a>.

        <question id="exec-introspection">
            Does your module use any kind of runtime type information (<code>instanceof</code>,
            work with <code>java.lang.Class</code>, etc.)?
            <hint>
            Check for cases when you have an object of type A and you also
            expect it to (possibly) be of type B and do some special action. That
            should be documented. The same applies on operations in meta-level
            (Class.isInstance(...), Class.isAssignableFrom(...), etc.).

    <answer id="exec-introspection">
        The displayed tabs are contained in a data model provided by the client.
        The &quot;user object&quot; of each element in the model may be a 
        Component instance, or something else (in which case the client code must
        supply a ComponentConverter instance to find the correct component when
        an element is selected).  The default implementation tests if the user
        object is a Component (which it always should be currently for NetBeans
        window system - a system of lazy loading of opened components based on
        ID's may be implemented in the future), and if it is not, returns null.

        <question id="exec-process">
            Do you execute an external process from your module? How do you ensure
            that the result is the same on different platforms? Do you parse output?
            Do you depend on result code?
            <hint>
            If you feed an input, parse the output please declare that as an API.

NetBeans 4.0 feature freeze
</answer>

<answer id="arch-usecases">
Primary use cases are in the NetBeans window system, as top level containers in the main window;  future use cases
include providing a consistent UI for tabs in the property sheet, the component inspector and the output window, but
this probably will not happen for 4.0.

All access must be on the AWT thread; this is enforced with assertions in some cases.

<answer id="perf-spi">
It is highly unlikely that any look and feel will provide its own UI delegates for the tab control.
In the event that they do, it is up to the look and feel author to ensure adequate performance.
