of the project making use of domain-specific features.
{@link org.netbeans.spi.project.ui.LogicalViewProvider} permits a project to
display itself however it likes in the <b>Projects</b> Explorer tab.
{@link org.netbeans.spi.project.ui.CustomizerProvider} permits the project to
be customized in an arbitrary way, typically opening a GUI dialog.</p>

<p>{@link org.netbeans.spi.project.ui.ProjectOpenedHook} may be used by projects
