<!-- Question: arch-what

     <question id="arch-what">
            What is this project good for?
            <hint>
            Please provide here few lines describing the the project,
            what problem it should solve, provide links to documentation, 
            specifications, etc.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="arch-what">
The module is for parsing JSP pages. The information produced by the parser is then
used in other parts of the product.
</answer>


<!-- Question: compat-i18n

     <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-i18n">
Yes.
</answer>



<!-- Question: compat-standards

     <question id="compat-standards">
            Does the module implements or defines any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or it deviates somehow?
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-standards">
The parser reads JSP pages which follow the JSP 1.2 standard (including pages 
written to older versions of the JSP specification). Itself, it does not implement 
or define a standard.
</answer>



<!-- Question: compat-version

     <question id="compat-version">
            Does your module properly coexists with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read settings? Will future
            versions be able to read settings?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
The module does not define any persistent information, so it does not need to 
read old or future settings.
</answer>



<!-- Question: dep-jre

     <question id="dep-jre">
            Which version of JRE you need (1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc.)?
            <hint>
            It is expected that if your module runs on 1.x that it will run 
            on 1.x+1 if no, state that please. Also describe here cases where
            you run different code on different versions of JRE and why.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="dep-jre">
It uses JRE 1.3.
</answer>



<!-- Question: dep-jrejdk

     <question id="dep-jrejdk">
            Do you require JDK or is JRE enough?
        </question>
-->
<answer id="dep-jrejdk">
The module requires the JDK. The reason is the fact that the Tomcat server, 
whose component is used as a third party library, needs the JDK.
</answer>

            Some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org">libraries</a>) and
            it is prefered to use this approach when more modules may
            depend on such third-party library.
            </hint>

            If your module consist just from one module JAR file, just confirm that.
            If it uses more than one JAR, describe where there are located, how
            they refer to each other. 
            If it consist of module JAR(s) and other files, please describe
            what is their purpose, why other files are necessary. Please 
            make sure that installation/deinstallation leaves the system

            Are packages of your module made inaccessible by not declaring them
            public?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used
            whenever possible (<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/download/apis/org/openide/doc-files/upgrade.html#3.4-public-packages">
            public packages

<!-- Question: exec-classloader

     <question id="exec-classloader">
            Does your code uses own classloader?
            <hint>
            A bit unusual. Please explain why and what for.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="exec-classloader">
Yes. It uses a classloader class imported from the <code>web-core</code> friend API. This classloader
is used by the Tomcat JSP compiler/parser libraries (it is passed as a parameter). The reason is that
the JSP compiler needs to load user classes present in the Web Application the user is developing, so the 
custom classloader simulates what the app will look like at runtime.
</answer>



<!-- Question: exec-component

     <question id="exec-component">
            Is execution of your code influenced by (string) property
            of any of your components?
            
            <hint>
            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an
            API as well.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="exec-component">
No.
</answer>



<!-- Question: exec-privateaccess

     <question id="exec-privateaccess">
            Are you aware of any other part of the system calling some of 
            your methods by reflection?
            <hint>
            If so, describe the "contract" as an API. Likely private or friend one, but
            still API and consider rewrite of it.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="exec-privateaccess">
No.
</answer>



<!-- Question: exec-property

     <question id="exec-property">
            Is execution of your code influenced by any environment of
            system (<code>System.getProperty</code>) property?
            
            <hint>
            If there is a property that can change the behaviour of your 
            code, somebody will likely use it. You should describe what it does 
            and the stability category of this API. You may use
            <PRE>
                &lt;property name="id" category="private" &gt;
                    description of the property, where it is used, what it influence, etc.

<!-- Question: exec-reflection

     <question id="exec-reflection">
            Does your code uses java.lang.reflect to execute some other code?
            <hint>
            This usually indicates a missing or unsufficient API in the other
            part of the system. If the other side is not aware of your dependency
            this contract can be easily broken.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="exec-reflection">
Yes. It uses reflection to access private fields and methods in the Tomcat JSP compiler/parser library.

<!-- Question: format-types

     <question id="format-types">
            Which file formats your code reads or writes on disk?
        </question>

            <hint>
            Please describe the interfaces you are searching for, where 
            are defined, whether you are searching for just one or more of them,
            if the order is important, etc. Also clasify the stability of such

            Do you remove entries of other modules from lookup?
            <hint>
            Why? Of course, that is possible, but it can be dangerous. Is the module
            your are masking resource from aware of what you are doing?

<!-- Question: perf-mem

     <question id="perf-mem">
            What is the amount of memory your component occupies? Estimate
            with a relaction to the number of windows, etc.
        </question>
-->
<answer id="perf-mem">
Relatively to the number of windows, it's pretty high (as there are no windows) :-)
It occupies a reasonable amount of memory necessary to do the parsing job.
It also keeps a cache of parsed tag libraries constructed from the user application.
</answer>



<!-- Question: perf-menus

     <question id="perf-menus">
            Does your module use dynamically changing context menus or

            <hint>Typically they are tasks like connecting over
            network, computing huge amount of data, compilation.
            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example
            using <code>RequestProcessor</code>), definitively it should 
            not block AWT thread.
            </hint>

            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="resources-file">
Yes. The Tomcat JSP Compiler library expects <code>java.io.File</code> to be passed to it.

<!-- Question: resources-layer

     <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create some files or

            component?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.). 
            </hint>

<!-- Question: resources-mask

     <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resource provided by another one in
            module layer? 
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.
