/**
 * check wheather the given runConfig has a chance to be successful or needs corrective measure.
 * Usecase would be the netbeans-run-plugin which requires a netbeans-public profile with a
 * jar and assembly configurations..
 * Similar to LateBoundPrerequisitesChecker but this one is called only once per action invokation.
 * Reruns (from output window for example) don't retrigger this.
 * <p>
 * The {@code PrerequisitesChecker} must be registered in <b>Project type's Lookup</b>,
 * and can be registered for a <b>specific packaging type</b>. There's a special packaging pseudo-type <b>_any</b>,
 * that is included for every packaging type, and its services are run after all packaging-specific ones. So the
 * execution happens the following order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>generic services, registered in project type's Lookup. They should establish the defaults suitable
 * for all projects.
 * <li>packaging-specific services. Can override values or provide special values specifically for the packaging type.
 * <li><i>_any</i> services. Provide a fallback if no packaging (or other specific) service created the necessary data. 
 * These are also run for all packaging types.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <div class="nonnormative">
 * Let's have some examples:

 * {@codesnippet RunUtilsTest.FallbackPrerequisiteChecker}
 * </div>
