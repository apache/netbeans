  <p>
   The Database module provides the 
   <api group="java" name="DatabaseExplorerAPI" type="export" category="official" url="@TOP@index.html"/>
   which allows access to the database connections and drivers
   defined in the Database Explorer. It allows a client to retrieve the
   connection list and their properties, to create new connections and remove
   existing ones. The Database Explorer also manages a list of JDBC drivers used to
   connect to databases. The API provides access to these drivers and allows
   to create new and remove existing drivers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The <api group="layer" name="DatabaseExplorerLayerAPI" type="export" category="official" url="@TOP@index.html"/> 
   allows for the declarative registration of database connections and JDBC
   drivers in the module layer. Database runtimes (which are representations of
   an instance of a database server) can also be registered in the layer.

 <answer id="arch-usecases">
  <usecase id="register-drivers" name="Registering JDBC ../db.drivers">
   <p>
    An external module can register JDBC drivers. A typical example is a module
    which provides integration with a database server. In this case the module
    contains the JDBC driver for that database server and uses the Database
    Explorer API to add it do the Database Explorer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another client of this API could be a module providing integration with a J2EE
    application server. Sometimes a J2EE application server bundles a database server
    for improving the out-of-the-box experience. When the server is registered
    in the IDE the JDBC drivers for the bundled database server are added to the Database
    Explorer.
   </p>
   <p>
    The drivers are registered by making calls on
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/JDBCDriverManager.html">JDBCDriverManager</a> or 
    by registering an XML file which describes the driver in the module layer.
    The XML file is described by the 
    <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/dtds/jdbc-driver-1_1.dtd">JDBC Driver DTD</a>. 
    An example of a registration file describing the JDBC driver for PostgreSQL follows:
   </p>
   <pre>
    &lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
    &lt;!DOCTYPE driver PUBLIC '-//NetBeans//DTD JDBC Driver 1.0//EN' 'http://www.netbeans.org/dtds/jdbc-driver-1_0.dtd'&gt;
    &lt;driver&gt;
      &lt;name value='postgresql-7'/&gt;
      &lt;display-name value='PostgreSQL (v7.0 and later)'/&gt;
      &lt;class value='org.postgresql.Driver'/&gt;
      &lt;urls&gt;
        &lt;url value='file:/folder1/folder2/drivers/pg74.1jdbc3.jar'/&gt;
      &lt;/urls&gt;
    &lt;/driver&gt;
   </pre>
   <p>
    This file should be registered in the <code>Databases/JDBCDrivers</code> folder of the module layer.
    To addres a bundled JAR inside the IDE the nbinst protocol can be used in the URLs: 
    <code>nbinst:/modules/ext/bundled-driver.jar</code>.
   </p>
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="get-jdbc-driver" name="Get the underlying JDBC Driver instance for a JDBCDriver">
   <p>
      You can use the <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/JDBCDriver.html#getDriver--">JDBCDriver.getDriver()</a>
      method to obtain a reference to the underlying JDBC Driver instance.  This is useful if you want to use the registered
      drivers but create your own JDBC connections independent of the Database Explorer.

   </p>
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="retrieve-drivers" name="Retrieving the list of JDBC ../db.drivers">
   <p>
    When creating a new connection the JDBC driver which it should use can be specified.
    A list of all the registered JDBC drivers can be retrieved using 
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/JDBCDriverManager.html#getDrivers--">JDBCDriverManager.getDrivers()</a>.
   </p>
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="register-runtimes" name="Registering database runtimes">
   <p>
    An external module can register new database runtimes. A database runtime
    is an abstraction of a database server instance 
    (usually bundled with the IDE, an integration module or with a J2EE server). It allows a database
    server instance to be started and stopped when a connection to this
    instance is made in the IDE. Database runtimes are represented by the
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/spi/db/explorer/DatabaseRuntime.html">DatabaseRuntime</a>
    SPI interface and are registered in the <code>Databases/Runtimes</code> of the module layer.
   </p>
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="create-connections" name="Creating database connections">
   <p>
    A module can create new database connections (for example to a bundled database).
    New connections can be added by calling 
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/DatabaseConnection.html#create-org.netbeans.api.db.explorer.JDBCDriver-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-boolean-">DatabaseConnection.create()</a>
    to create a new DatabaseConnection instance and then 
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/ConnectionManager.html#addConnection-org.netbeans.api.db.explorer.DatabaseConnection-">ConnectionManager.addConnection()</a> to
    add the connection to the Database Explorer.
   </p>
   <p>
    New connections can also be added by registering them in the module layer. 
    The format of the registration file is described by the 
    <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/dtds/connection-1_0.dtd">Database Connection DTD</a>. 
    An example of a registration file describing a connection to a PostgreSQL database follows:
   </p>
   <pre>
    &lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
    &lt;!DOCTYPE connection PUBLIC '-//NetBeans//DTD Database Connection 1.1//EN' 'http://www.netbeans.org/dtds/connection-1_1.dtd'&gt;
    &lt;connection&gt;
      &lt;driver-class value='org.postgresql.Driver'/&gt;
      &lt;driver-name value='postgres-7'/&gt;
      &lt;database-url value='jdbc:postgresql:test'/&gt;
      &lt;schema value='public'/&gt;
      &lt;user value='test'/&gt;
      &lt;password value='cGFzc3dvcmQ='/&gt;
    &lt;/connection&gt;
   </pre>
   <p>
    This file should be registered in the <code>Databases/Connections</code> folder 
    of the module layer.  
    </p>
    <p>
    The password element is optional, but if it is included, 
    its value must be the Base64 encoding of the UTF-8 representation of the 
    password.  Note that the UTF-8 representation of passwords composed entirely of
    ASCII characters is the same as their ASCII representation, so for such 
    passwords all that needs to be done is to convert them to Base64.
    </p>
    <p>
    Base64 encoding serves as a simple scrambling to prevent 
    accidental revelation of the password.  It is not indended to offer any 
    real security.   You can protect the password by assigning appropriate
    file protections to the connection XML file.
   </p>
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="retrieve-connections" name="Retrieving and displaying the list of database connections">
   <p>
    Sometimes the list of connections needs to be displayed somewhere
    else in the IDE than the Runtime tab. A typical example is the SQL Editor,
    which allows the user to select the database connection which the SQL statement
    will be executed against in a combo box in the editor toolbar. 
    The list of connections can be obtained by calling
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/ConnectionManager.html#getConnections--">ConnectionManager.getConnections()</a>,
    which returns an array of 
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/DatabaseConnection.html">DatabaseConnection</a>
    instances.
   </p>
   <p>
    The client usually needs to show the display name of the connection. The
    display name can be retrieved using the 
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/DatabaseConnection.html#getDisplayName--">DatabaseConnection.getDisplayName()</a>
    method.
   </p>
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="retrieve-connection-props" name="Retrieving the properties of database connections">
   <p>
    Sometimes a client needs to retrieve the connection properties, such as the driver class.
    An example could be a module for a J2EE server creating a connection pool. The properties can
    be retrieved using the <code>getDriverClass()</code>, <code>getDatabaseURL()</code>, 
    <code>getSchema()</code>, <code>getUser()</code> and <code>getPassword()</code>
    methods of the 
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/DatabaseConnection.html">DatabaseConnection</a>
    class.
   </p>
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="new-connection" name="Showing the New Database Connection dialog">
   <p>
    Usually when displaying a list of connections (usually in a combo box),
    the last item is "New Connection", which displays the standard New Database Connection 
    dialog of the Database Explorer. This can be achieved by calling one of the
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/ConnectionManager.html#showAddConnectionDialog-org.netbeans.api.db.explorer.JDBCDriver-">ConnectionManager.showAddConnectionDialog()</a> methods.
   </p>
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="remove-connection" name="Remove a database connection">
   <p>
       A user of this API may want to remove a connection from the list of connections
       registered by the Database Explorer.  This is done using 
       <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/ConnectionManager.html#removeConnection-org.netbeans.api.db.explorer.DatabaseConnection-">ConnectionManager.removeConnection()</a>
   </p>
  </usecase>
 <usecase id="connect-database" name="Connecting to a database">
   <p>
    A component which provides database functionality (such as the SQL Editor)
    will need to connect to a database. This can be achieved using the
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/ConnectionManager.html#showConnectionDialog-org.netbeans.api.db.explorer.DatabaseConnection-">DatabaseConnection.showConnectionDialog()</a>
    method and the <code>java.sql.Connection</code> instance can be retrieved using the 
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/DatabaseConnection.html#getJDBCConnection--">getJDBCConnection()</a>
    method.
   </p>
   <p>
     If you want to connect to the database without showing a dialog or any kind of UI, you can use the
     <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/ConnectionManager.html#connect-org.netbeans.api.db.explorer.DatabaseConnection-">DatabaseConnection.connect()</a>
     method.
   </p>
  </usecase>
 <usecase id="test-connection" name="Test a database connection for validity">
   <p>
    You may want to test to make sure the underlying physical JDBC connection
    obtained from a DatabaseConnection is either valid or null.  This is done using the
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/DatabaseConnection.html#getJDBCConnection-boolean-">
        DatabaseConnection.getJDBCConnection(boolean test)</a>
    method, which validates the underlying connection before returning it.  If the
    connection is invalid, it marks the DatabaseConnection as disconnected and returns null.
   </p>
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="connections-combo-box" name="Displaying the database connections in the UI">
   <p>
    A component which provides database functionality (such as the SQL Editor
    or a module providing support for data sources) will need to let the user
    select the a database connection, usually through a combo box.
    This can be achieved using the
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/support/DatabaseExplorerUIs.html#connect-javax.swing.JComboBox-org.netbeans.api.db.explorer.ConnectionManager-">DatabaseExplorerUIs.connect()</a>
    method. The <code>JComboBox</code> passed to the method will be filled with the list of connections as returned by 
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/explorer/ConnectionManager.html#getConnections--">ConnectionManager.getConnections()</a>, followed by a separator
    and a <em>New Database Connection</em> item which will display the dialog for adding a new database connection when selected.
   </p>
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="metadata-transfer" name="Drag and drop support for database objects">
   <p>
    A component might need to allow database tables from the Database Explorer to 
    be dragged to a visual editor. An API is provided in <code>DatabaseMetaDataTransfer</code>
    containing <code>DataFlavor</code>s for database objects and nested classes
    encapsulating those database objects during a drag and drop transfer.
   </p>
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="sql-identifier-support" name="Get support for working with SQL identifiers">
   <p>
       A component might need support for working with SQL identifiers. In particular,
       it's important to know when to quote a SQL identifier.  The
       <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/api/db/sql/support/SQLIdentifiers.Quoter.html">
           SQLIdentifiers.Quoter</a> class is provided for this.
   </p>

        <question id="resources-file" when="final">
            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the preferred
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.

        <question id="resources-layer" when="final">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create any files or
            folders in it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            components?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.). 
            </hint>
        </question>

 <answer id="resources-layer">
  <p>
   Yes. The module contains a standard layer which describes menu items, actions and services. The
   folders Databases/Connections, Databases/JDBCDrivers and Databases/Runtimes, where database connections, 
   JDBC drivers and database runtimes are registered, are created.

        <question id="resources-mask" when="final">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resources provided by other modules in
            their layers?
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and classify according to 
            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#categories">
            common stability categories</a>.

        <question id="security-grant" when="final">
            Does your code grant additional rights to some other code?
            <hint>Avoid using a class loader that adds extra
            permissions to loaded code unless really necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by
            calling AccessController.doPrivileged().</hint>

            Does your functionality require modifications to the standard policy file?
            <hint>Your code might pass control to third-party code not
            coming from trusted domains. This could be code downloaded over the
            network or code coming from libraries that are not bundled
            with NetBeans. Which permissions need to be granted to which domains?</hint>

            Does your module uses preferences via Preferences API? Does your module use NbPreferences or
            or regular JDK Preferences ? Does it read, write or both ? 
            Does it share preferences with other modules ? If so, then why ?
            <hint>
                You may use
                    &lt;api type="export" group="preferences"

                    &lt;/api&gt;
                Due to XML ID restrictions, rather than /org/netbeans/modules/foo give the "name" as org.netbeans.modules.foo.
                Note that if you use NbPreferences this name will then be the same as the code name base of the module.
