      The module tracks changes made on files in the IDE and provides an

            What other NetBeans projects and modules does this one depend on?

            Depending on other NetBeans projects influnces the ability of
            users of your work to customize their own branded version of
            NetBeans by enabling and disabling some modules. Too
            much dependencies restrict this kind of customization. If that
            is your case, then you may want to split your functionality into
            pieces of autoload, eager and regular modules which can be
            enabled independently. Usually the answer to this question
            is generated from your <code>project.xml</code> file, but

            folders in it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            components?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

        <question id="resources-mask" when="final">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resources provided by other modules in
            their layers?
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

        <question id="resources-preferences" when="final">
            Does your module uses preferences via Preferences API? Does your module use NbPreferences or
            or regular JDK Preferences ? Does it read, write or both ? 
            Does it share preferences with other modules ? If so, then why ?
            <hint>
                You may use
                    &lt;api type="export" group="preferences"
                    name="preference node name" category="private"&gt;
                    description of individual keys, where it is used, what it
                    influences, whether the module reads/write it, etc.
                    &lt;/api&gt;
                Due to XML ID restrictions, rather than /org/netbeans/modules/foo give the "name" as org.netbeans.modules.foo.
                Note that if you use NbPreferences this name will then be the same as the code name base of the module.

 <answer id="resources-preferences">
  <p>
   The module will read and write user options through NbPreferences. None of them will be shared with other modules.

            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.

            permissions to loaded code unless really necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by
