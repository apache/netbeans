MSG_COMPOSITE_COMPONENT_DISPLAYNAME=Display Name:
MSG_COMPOSITE_COMPONENT_SHORTDESCRIPTION=Short Description:
MSG_TAG_ATTRS=Tag attributes
MSG_NO_TAG_ATTRS=The tag does not declare any attributes
MSG_NO_DESCRIPTOR=No Library Descriptor Available
MSG_ParsingFaceletsLibraries=Scanning Facelets libraries...

HELP_id=The component identifier
HELP_parent=The parent component for which this component is a child or a facet.
HELP_rendered=A flag that, if set to true, indicates that this component should \
be processed during all phases of the request processing lifecycle. \
The default value is \u201ctrue\u201d.
HELP_rendererType=Identifier of the Renderer instance (from the set of Renderer \
instances supported by the RenderKit associated with the \
component tree we are processing. If this property is set, several \
operations during the request processing lifecycle (such as decode \
and the encodeXxx family of methods) will be delegated to a \
Renderer instance of this type. If this property is not set, the \
component must implement these methods directly
HELP_rendersChildren=A flag that, if set to true, indicates that this component manages \
the rendering of all of its children components (so the JSF \
implementation should not attempt to render them). The default \
implementation in UIComponentBase delegates this setting to \
the associated Renderer, if any, and returns false otherwise.
HELP_transient=A flag that, if set to true, indicates that this component must not \
be included in the state of the component tree. The default \
implementation in UIComponentBase returns false for this property.
HELP_class=The component CSS class name
HELP_binding=Binds the component to a backing bean property, as specified in the JSF specification.
