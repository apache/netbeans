<h2>Using Balloon Evaluation</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>The balloon expression evaluator instantly shows you the current
value of the expression at which your cursor is pointing in the
Source Editor. If the expression is active in the current context,
the value is displayed in a tooltip.
</p>
<p>
In cases where a program includes different variables with the same
name, the Source Editor displays the value based on the current
context, and not on the instance of the variable in the source code.
