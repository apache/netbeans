The Input/Output API is a small API module
which contains <code>InputOutput</code> and related interfaces used in
driving the Output Window. The normal implementation is <code>org.netbeans.core.output2</code>.

<!--
        <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.

<!--
        <question id="compat-standards">

<!--
        <question id="compat-version">
            Can your module coexist with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read all old settings? Will future
            versions be able to read your current settings? Can you read
            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.

            Some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org">libraries</a>) and
            it is prefered to use this approach when more modules may

            public?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used

            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an
            API as well.

            If there is a property that can change the behaviour of your

            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources

            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file&apos;s name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API

 <answer id="arch-usecases">
  <p>There is an SPI but additional implementations are not expected. The API is most important.</p>
  <p>
   Simple usage example:
  </p>
<pre>
<span class="type">InputOutput</span> <span class="variable-name">io</span> = IOProvider.getDefault().getIO(<span class="string">"My Window"</span>, true);
io.select();
<span class="type">OutputWriter</span> <span class="variable-name">w</span> = io.getOut();
w.println(<span class="string">"Line of plain text."</span>);
<span class="type">OutputListener</span> <span class="variable-name">listener</span> = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type">OutputListener</span>() {
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">outputLineAction</span>(<span class="type">OutputEvent</span> <span class="variable-name">ev</span>) {
        StatusDisplayer.getDefault().setStatusText(<span class="string">"Hyperlink clicked!"</span>);
    }
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">outputLineSelected</span>(<span class="type">OutputEvent</span> <span class="variable-name">ev</span>) {
        <span class="comment">// Let's not do anything special.
</span>    }
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">outputLineCleared</span>(<span class="type">OutputEvent</span> <span class="variable-name">ev</span>) {
        <span class="comment">// Leave it blank, no state to remove.
</span>    }

w.println(<span class="string">"Line of hyperlinked text."</span>, listener, true);

            Do you define or register any ant tasks that other can use?
            
            <hint>
            If you provide an ant task that users can use, you need to be very
            careful about its syntax and behaviour, as it most likely forms an
	          API for end users and as there is a lot of end users, their reaction
            when such API gets broken can be pretty strong.

        <question id="exec-threading" when="impl">
            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to?
            <hint>
                If your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
                Also describe when any events are fired: synchronously, asynchronously, etc.

            Does your code grant additional rights to some other code?
            <hint>Avoid using a class loader that adds extra
            permissions to loaded code unless really necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by
