# It is stated, that access to packages outside com.formdev.flatlaf and
# com.formdev.flatlaf.util is not a supported API. Setting the implementation
# version allows modules, that need to do this (SwingX integration) to access
# internals
#
# https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4619
#
# So when FlatLaf is updated, the OpenIDE-Module-Implementation-Version entry
# in manifest.mf needs to be updated to match the new FlatLaf version.
