/**
 * An Icon implementation that scales a source image to the specified dimensions. Can be used to
 * produce sharp images on HiDPI displays, without relying on MultiResolutionImage, which exists
 * only since JDK 9. This also sidesteps https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8212226 on
 * Windows. It's recommended to use a source image with dimensions that are exactly twice those of
 * the icon's logical dimensions. A double-resolution source image will automatically be scaled
 * down to 1x, 1.5x, or other HiDPI scaling factors as needed.
