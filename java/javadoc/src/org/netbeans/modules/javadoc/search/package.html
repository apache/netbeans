<h2>Search JavaDoc Package</h2>

<h3>Entry Points</h3>
{@link SearchDocAction} registered in module layer.


<h3>Control Flow</h3>

<pre>
performAction() toFind
    IndexSearch UI button_actionPerformed
    JavadocSearchEngine[Impl]
        foreach javadoc fs
            javadocSearchType = fs.getJavadocSearchType()
            javadocSearchType.getSearchThread(toFind)
            IndexSearchThread (Jdk12SearchThread[_japan])
                insertDocIndexItem()
    JavadocSearchEngine[Impl] callback (presenting them in UI)
</pre>


<h3>Projectization Tasks</h3>

DocFileSystems must be found in project resources.
Define javadoc resources lookup criteria. Mimics classpath lookup.
(Library ref FileObjects has something in their lookup. the
something is provided by JavaDocVolumeProvider.)

How do I list project resource PMs. In project resource (descriptor) containers.
