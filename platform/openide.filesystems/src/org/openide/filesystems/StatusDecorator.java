/**
 * Provides decorations based on file state. 
 * Allows a filesystem to annotate a group of files with additional markers.
 * <p>
 * This could be useful, for example, for a filesystem supporting version
 * control. It could annotate names and icons of data nodes according to whether
 * the files were current, locked, etc. 
 * <p>
 * Textual and HTML markup annotations are supported. The implementation must
 * support at least plain annotation.
 * <p>
 * This interface replaces and supersedes the former {@code FileSystem.Status}. 
 * Other markers are possible, e.g. icon, but they are not provided in this interface.
 * For icon or other GUI artifacts, please see {@code openide.filesystems.nb} module, 
 * the {@code ImageDecorator} interface and {@code FileUIUtils} utility class.

     * this interface to supply HTML annotations) should return null if

     * <p>Note that since the {@code name} argument must be free of HTML,
     * it is tricky to use this decorator on a {@code Node} arising from
     * foreign code, to chain decorators, or otherwise when you wish to add
     * decorations to an HTML label whose creation you do not control.
     * As a workaround, pass in an arbitrary but HTML-free string as an argument
     * (something unlikely to occur elsewhere) and replace that string in the
     * result with the original HTML label - under the assumption that the
     * decorator does not inspect its argument but merely adds some prefix
     * and/or suffix.
     *
     * @param name the name suggested by default. It cannot contain HTML
     * markup tags but must escape HTML metacharacters. For example
     * "&lt;default package&gt;" is illegal but "&amp;lt;default package&amp;gt;"
     * is fine.
     * @param files an immutable set of {@link FileObject}s belonging to this filesystem
     * @return the annotated name. It may be the same as the passed-in name.
     * It may be null if getStatus returned status that doesn't implement
     * HtmlStatus but plain Status.
