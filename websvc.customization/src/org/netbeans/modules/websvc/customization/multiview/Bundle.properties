ERR_INVALID_PACKAGE=\"{0}\" is not a valid package name.

TOOLTIP_PACKAGE=<html><font color=blue>You may change the package where classes will be generated.</html>
TOOLTIP_ENABLE_ASYNC=<html><font color=blue>If you enable this checkbox, asynchronous method calls will<br>\
be generated for this operation.<br>For example, for operation foo, three operations will be generated:<br>\
<bold>foo</bold>, <bold>fooAsync</bold>, and <bold>fooResponse</bold>.</html>
TOOLTIP_ENABLE_WRAPPER=<html><font color=blue>This checkbox is enabled by default. When this is enabled, <br>messages that consist of\
 complex types are mapped individually to the component Java types. <br>If this is disabled, complex types are mapped to \
the complex Java class.</html>
TOOLTIP_ENABLE_MIME=<html><font color=blue>If you are transmitting large binary data, <br>enabling this checkbox allows for the efficient transmission\
 the data over the wire.</html>
TOOLTIP_PORTTYPE_CLASS=<html><font color=blue>You may customize the name of the class generated for the portType. <br>If you do not customize,\
 the default is the value of the name attribute of the wsdl:portType element, <br>subject to the JAXB rules of XML to Java identifiers.</html>
TOOLTIP_SERVICE_CLASS=<html><font color=blue>You may customize the name of the class generated for the service. <br>If you do not customize,\
 the default is the value of the name attribute of the wsdl:service element, <br>subject to the JAXB rules of XML to Java identifiers.</html>
TOOLTIP_GET_PORT=<html><font color=blue>You may customize the name of the method for obtaining a service port. <br>If you do not customize,\
 the default is the value of the name attribute of the wsdl:port element, <br>subject to the JAXB rules of XML to Java identifiers,<br> after which the JavaBeans naming convention is applied to come up with the method name.</html> \ 
TOOLTIP_PORTTYPE_FAULT_CLASS=<html><font color=blue>You may customize the name of the exception class generated for the fault. <br>If you do not customize,\
 the default is the value of the name attribute of the wsdl:fault element, <br>subject to the JAXB rules of XML to Java identifiers.</html>
TOOLTIP_PORTTYPE_METHOD=<html><font color=blue>You may customize the name of the method generated for the operation. <br>If you do not customize,\
 the default is the value of the name attribute of the wsdl:operation element, <br>subject to the JAXB rules of XML to Java identifiers.</html>
MSG_EXTERNAL_BINDING=<html>The wsdlLocation attribute of the external customization file should specify a relative path to the location \
 of the wsdl in the IDE. <br>If this is a JAXWS customization file, the value of the wsdlLocation attribute will automatically be changed to: <p><\"{0}\"</p> If this is a JAXB customization \
 file, you must manually change the schemaLocation attribute to a value that is a relative path from this wsdl location. <br>Generally, the value of schemaLocation should be relative to the wsdl directory, e.g., ../wsdl/&lt;schema-location&gt; <br>Do you want to continue?</html>
