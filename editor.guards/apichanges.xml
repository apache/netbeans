INFO FOR PEOPLE ADDING CHANGES:

Check the DTD (apichanges.dtd) for details on the syntax. You do not
need to regenerate the HTML, as this is part of Javadoc generation; just
change the XML. Rough syntax of a change (several parts optional):

<change>
    <api name="compiler"/>
    <summary>Some brief description here, can use <b>XHTML</b></summary>
    <version major="1" minor="99"/>
    <date day="13" month="6" year="2001"/>
    <author login="jrhacker"/>
    <compatibility addition="yes"/>
    <description>
        The main description of the change here.
        Again can use full <b>XHTML</b> as needed.
    </description>
    <class package="org.openide.compiler" name="DoWhatIWantCompiler"/>
    <issue number="14309"/>
</change>

Also permitted elements: <package>, <branch>. <version> is API spec
version, recommended for all new changes. <compatibility> should say
if things were added/modified/deprecated/etc. and give all information
related to upgrading old code. List affected top-level classes and
link to issue numbers if applicable. See the DTD for more details.

Changes need not be in any particular order, they are sorted in various
ways by the stylesheet anyway.

Dates are assumed to mean "on the trunk". If you *also* make the same
change on a stabilization branch, use the <branch> tag to indicate this
and explain why the change was made on a branch in the <description>.

Please only change this file on the trunk! Rather: you can change it
on branches if you want, but these changes will be ignored; only the
trunk version of this file is important.

Deprecations do not count as incompatible, assuming that code using the
deprecated calls continues to see their documented behavior. But do
specify deprecation="yes" in <compatibility>.

This file is not a replacement for Javadoc: it is intended to list changes,
not describe the complete current behavior, for which ordinary documentation
is the proper place.

                <p>
                    APIs exposed and actually used on GuardedDocument in <code>editor.lib</code> module is now declared in Editor Guarded Sections.
                    Clients may depend on Guarded Sections instead of on fading-away editor.lib module.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dependency on <code>openide.text</code> eliminated, new SPI <code>GuardedRegionMarker</code>
                    is added for Documents that are willing to style their contents according to guarded areas.
                </p>

            <description>
                <p>When this option is set, setting the content of a GuardedSection will pass the data through the given
                guarded writer and back through the given guarded reader, to ensure the result is the same
                as if it would be read from the disk.</p>
                <p>Note that this new mode is not fully compatible with the original mode, e.g. all the set methods
                of all the GuardedSection classes will throw IllegalStateException if invoked inside the write&amp;read part.</p>

            <description>
                In order to use proper encoding by guards impl it is necessary to
                change GuardedSectionsProvider to accept encoding rather as <code>java.nio.Charset</code> instance
                than as a plain encoding name.
                <ul>
                    <li><code>Reader createGuardedReader(InputStream stream, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException</code>
                        replaced with
                        <code>Reader createGuardedReader(InputStream stream, Charset charset)</code></li>
                    <li><code>Writer createGuardedWriter(OutputStream stream, String encoding) throws UnsupportedEncodingException</code>
                        replaced with
