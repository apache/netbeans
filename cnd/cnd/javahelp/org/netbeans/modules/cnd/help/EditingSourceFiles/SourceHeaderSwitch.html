<h2>Switching Between Source and Header Files</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Source/Header switch lets you easily visit corresponding
source and header files. The switch toggles between files with same
name and corresponding extension, for example, <tt>code.cc</tt> and
<tt>code.h</tt>.
</p>
<p><b>To switch between source and header files, do one of the following:</b>
<ul>
<li>With the cursor in a source or header file in the Source Editor
window, click the Go to Source/Header button in the tool bar.
</li>
<li>With the cursor in a source file in the Source Editor
    window, right-click and choose Navigate &gt; Go to Header.
</li>
<li>With the cursor in a header file in the Source Editor
window, right-click and choose Navigate &gt; Go to Source.
</li>
</ul>
If a file with the same name and a corresponding
extension is found in the project, the file is opened in the editor.
