            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number

            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used

            public packages
            </a>). If you do not restrict access to your classes you are
            making it too easy for other people to misuse your implementation
            details, that is why you should have good reason for not 
            restricting package access.

                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might

            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called

            provides uniform access to such resources and is the preferred
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when

            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create any files or

            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
