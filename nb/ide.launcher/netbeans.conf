# Default locations of userdir and cachedir:
# (http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqWhatIsUserdir)
#
# On Windows ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with "<AppData>\NetBeans" where <AppData> is user's
# value of "AppData" key in Windows Registry under
# "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders"
# and ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with "<Local AppData>\NetBeans\Cache" where <Local AppData> is user's
# value of "Local AppData" key in Windows Registry under
# "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders"
#
# On Mac ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with "~/Library/Application Support/NetBeans" and
# ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} with "~/Library/Caches/NetBeans"
#
# On other systems ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with "~/.netbeans" and ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} with "~/.cache/netbeans"
#
# You can also use ${HOME} variable which will be replaced with
# user.home JVM system property value. This variable is valid only in
# netbeans_default_userdir and netbeans_default_cachedir properties.
#
# NOTE: If you specify a non-default userdir path on command line
# (--userdir option) and don't specify a cachedir path (--cachedir option),
# cachedir will be in "<userdir>/var/cache".
#
# Cachedir must be different from userdir. The same cachedir and userdir
# would cause problems.

# Options used by NetBeans launcher by default:
# (can be overridden by explicit command line switches)

# Note that default -Xmx is selected for you by the JVM automatically.
# You can find these values in var/log/messages.log file in your userdir.
# The automatically selected value can be overridden by specifying -J-Xmx
# here or on the command line.
