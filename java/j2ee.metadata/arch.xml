  <p>
   This module provides the <api group="java" name="GenericJavaEEMetadataModelAPI" type="export" category="devel" url="@TOP@index.html"/>,
   which is a generic framework for models of Java EE metadata expressed as either XML deployment descriptors or Java annotations. 
   The framework itself doesn't provide access to any specific metadata. Instead, it allows metadata providers to plug in SPI
   implementations returning whichever kind of metadata they want to provide.

  <usecase id="metadata-access" name="Accessing metadata models">
   <p>
    A module wishing to access Java EE metadata obtains a metadata model, which is encapsulated
    by the <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/metadata/model/api/MetadataModel.html">MetadataModel</a>
    class. The client then implements a model action, represented by the 
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/metadata/model/api/MetadataModelAction.html">MetadataModelAction</a> class,
    and executes this action in the model context by calling the model's 
    <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/metadata/model/api/MetadataModel.html#runReadAction-org.netbeans.modules.j2ee.metadata.model.api.MetadataModelAction-">runReadAction()</a>
    method:
   </p>
   <pre>
    MetadataModel&lt;SomeMetadata&gt; model = // ...
    String result = model.runReadAction(new MetadataModelAction&lt;SomeMetadata, String&gt;() {
        public String run(SomeMetadata metadata) {
            // ... do something with metadata, e.g.
            // compute a String value
            return value;
        }
    }
   </pre>
   <p>
    The way to obtain the model itself, as well as the kinds of metadata encapsulated by <code>MetadataModel</code> is 
    metadata and metadata provider-specific and is not addressed by this API.
   </p>
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="providing-metadata" name="Providing metadata models">
   <p>
    A metadata provider first defines a root class describing the metadata, e.g., <code>SomeMetadata</code>. Then the provider
    implements the <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/metadata/model/spi/MetadataModelImplementation.html">MetadataModelImplementation</a> interface and
    creates a <code>MetadataModel</code> using <a href="@TOP@org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/metadata/model/spi/MetadataModelFactory.html">MetadataModelFactory</a>.
    Then the provider defines a way to return the model to its clients:
   </p>
   <pre>
    private SomeMetadataModelImplementation modelImpl = new SomeMetadataModelImplementation();
    private MetadataModel&lt;SomeMetadata&gt; model = MetadataModelFactory.createMetadataModel(modelImpl);

    /**
     * Call this to retrieve the model of some metadata.
     */
    public MetadataModel&lt;SomeMetadata&gt; getSomeMetadataModel() {
        return model;
    }

    // ... 

    private class SomeMetadataModelImplementation implements MetadataModelImplementation&lt;SomeMetadata&gt; {

        // ...

    }
   </pre>
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="providing-multiple-metadata" name="Providing multiple metadata models">
   <p>
    A metadata provider might need to provide several kinds of metadata models at once. Furthermore, since there
    can be many models available or for backward compatibility reasons it might be impractical to provide 
    a method for each of the models. In this case the provider may define a method like:
   </p>
   <pre>
    public MetadataModel&lt;T&gt; getMetadataModel(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz) {
        // ...
    }
   </pre>
   <p>
    The types of <code>Class</code> which may be passed to the method is a part of the contract between
    the provider and its clients.

            Depending on other NetBeans projects influnces the ability of
            users of your work to customize their own branded version of
            NetBeans by enabling and disabling some modules. Too
            much dependencies restrict this kind of customization. If that
