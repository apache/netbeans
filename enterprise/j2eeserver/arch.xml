J2EE Server Module provides support for development of J2EE modules and framework for J2EE server management and for J2EE deployment in IDE.

</answer>

<answer id="arch-overall">

<p>
    There are two separate api/spi sets in j2eeserver. The devmodules
    api/spi is for j2ee development modules (web, j2ee app, etc). The
    plugins api/spi is for server plugins.
</p>

<api name="J2EEServer-devmodules" type="export" category="friend" group="java">
    The spi classes are to be subclassed by dev modules and to be provided
    as cookies on the development nodes. The api classes are to be used to

  J2EE Server module serves as an integration point between two kinds of netbeans modules:
  <ul>
    <li><b>server plugins</b> (or simply plugins) that integrate various J2EE servers in IDE</li>
    <li><b>devmodules</b> - netbeans modules that provide support for development
    of J2EE modules (web module, EJB module, J2EE Application, etc.) and need to deploy

J2EE Server Module enables using <a href="https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/mrel/jsr088/index.html">
J2EE Deployment API</a> (aka JSR88) for plugin integration.
In addition to that it provides its own API for <b>incremental deployment</b>,
JSP compilation, server life cycle management (start/stop/debugging mode).
Incremental deployment deploys J2EE modules to server from a directory structure 
without requiring to build a J2EE module archive. It also takes the minimal action
to "refresh" the module on server rahter then completely undeploying and deploying
the module (or even restarting the server).
</p>
<p>J2EE Server Module is integrated with Ant based project system (in the devmodules part) 
and deployment is called via custom Ant task (works only in IDE).
</p>
<p>
J2EE Server module provides basic UI for server managment and server plugins
can provide customized UI.
</p>
<p>
J2EE Server module furthermore supports devmodules by managing server libraries i.e. it provides compilation classpath and registers sources and javadocs in lookup.

<usecase id="deployment-api-compliant-server" name="Deployment API Compliant Server Plugin">
A server that supports Deployment API can be integrated in IDE so that J2EE 
modules could be deployed to it from IDE. It will not support incremental
deployment, start/stop server or JSP compilation.
<p><i>
In order to do this the plugin needs to add the server classes that 
implement Deployment API to classpath and to provide a 
<a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/deployment/plugins/api/doc-files/plugin-layer-file.html">
layer file</a> that will 
register the server in IDE (specifying URL, user name and password) and 
register a 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/api/javax/enterprise/deploy/spi/factories/DeploymentFactory.html">
factory class</a> from Deployment API. Beside that server plugin must also implement some other mandatory APIs.
</i></p>
</usecase>


<usecase id="deployment-api-non-complient-server" name="Plugin for Server that does not support Deployment API">
If a J2EE server does not support Deployment API still needs to be possible 
to implement a server plugin for it. 
<p><i>
In this case the plugin needs to implement the Deployment API interfaces (
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/api/javax/enterprise/deploy/spi/factories/DeploymentFactory.html">
DeploymentFactory</a>, 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/api/javax/enterprise/deploy/spi/DeploymentManager.html">
DeploymentManager</a>) and delegate to whetever interface the specific J2EE server provides.
An example of this is the Tomcat5 plugin implemented in 
<a href="https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master/enterprise/tomcat5">tomcatint/tomcat5</a>
module, although it only supports deployment of web modules and it also supports
some optional interfaces defined by J2EE Server Module in addition to the Deployment API.
</i></p>
</usecase>

<usecase id="j2ee-platform" name="Server Plugin mandatory APIs">

Each server plugin is required to provide J2EE platform which devmodules may use beside else for obtaining compilation classpath.

<p><i>Plugins must implement
<a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/deployment/plugins/spi/J2eePlatformImpl.html">
J2eePlatformImpl</a> interface and register it via <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/deployment/plugins/spi/J2eePlatformFactory.html">J2eePlatformFactory</a> whose instance must be registered in the module <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/deployment/plugins/api/doc-files/plugin-layer-file.html">
layer file</a>. Devmodules then may access the <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/deployment/devmodules/api/J2eePlatform.html">J2eePlatform</a> interface via the <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/deployment/devmodules/api/Deployment.html">Deployment</a> utility class.
</i></p>
</usecase>

<usecase id="plugin-with-optional-apis" name="Server Plugin that implements optional APIs">
In practice plugins will likely want to provide tighter integration with IDE 
that is specified in Deployment API.
They can choose to provide any or all of the optional parts of plugin API:
incremental deployment, JSP compilation, start/stop/debug server support and/or 
customized UI for server management.
<p><i>
In order to do this plugin needs to implement the additional interfaces
and register their instances in module 
<a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/deployment/plugins/api/doc-files/plugin-layer-file.html">
layer file</a> and in 
<a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/deployment/plugins/api/doc-files/netbeans-deployment-dtd.txt">

<usecase id="devmodule-integration" name="Devmodule integration" >
Implemetors of J2EE module support (web module, EJB module, J2EE Application, etc.) 
need to be able to provide UI to deploy or debug their modules on any J2EE server 
that has a corresponding plugin and supports given type of J2EE module. 
The deployment needs to work both for Deployment API based (full) deployment 
and incremental deployment (this needs to be transparent for the devmodules). 
Devmodules also need to provide UI for editing server specific configuration 
files existing in their sources. In addition to that, J2EE Application devmodule 
needs to communicate with devmodules representing J2EE module that constitute 
the application.

<p>
<i>
This is achieved by devmodules implementing the devmodules API. Typically this 
will be done by subclassing a support class in devmodules SPI but direct 
implementation of devmodules API should also be possible. The mechanism of
discovery of devmodule implementation is highly dependent on how devmodules
are represented in IDE (e.g. as projects or DataObjects) so this part of API 
is the least stable.
</i>
</p>
<p>
The API package provides abstractions of 
<a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/deployment/devmodules/api/J2eeModule.html">J2eeModule</a> and a
J2EEModuleContainer
(a module that contains other modules, such as J2EE application).
Two utility classes provide direct access to 
<a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/deployment/devmodules/api/Deployment.html">Deployment</a>
and to a 
<a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/deployment/devmodules/api/JSPServletFinder.html">JSPServletFinder</a>.
The SPI package contains utility classes for implementation of J2eeModule and J2eeModuleContainer.

The only settings are the server registry content and information about deployed modules.
The format of server registry content settings is stable and should be read by

        <question  id="perf-spi" when="init">
            How the performance of the plugged in code will be enforced?
            <hint>
            If you allow foreign code to be plugged into your own module, how
            do you enforce, that it will behave correctly and fast and will not
            negatively influence the performance of your own module?
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="perf-spi">
There is no way to enforce performance of SPI.
Performance of module does depend on plugin and devmodule performance.

            Does your code grant additional rights to some other code?
            <hint>Avoid using a class loader that adds extra
            permissions to loaded code unless really necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by

            If you provide an ant task that users can use, you need to be very
            careful about its syntax and behaviour, as it most likely forms an
	          API for end users and as there is a lot of end users, their reaction
            when such API gets broken can be pretty strong.

   Module itself does not define any. There exist ant tasks related to this

            Does your module uses preferences via Preferences API? Does your module use NbPreferences or

                Due to XML ID restrictions, rather than /org/netbeans/modules/foo give the "name" as org.netbeans.modules.foo.
