/**
 * Methods for determining the local host's own address. The methods provide
 * two benefits over the core JDK classes.:
 * <ul>
 *    <li><i>Caching</i>. Results from the methods are cached and can therefore
 *       be returned without blocking. An application should call 
 *       {@link #warmUp()} during the application's startup phase
 *       so that results are readily available when needed.
 *    </li>
 *    <li><i>IP protocol preference</i>. All methods allow to state
 *       an explicit preference for IPv4 vs IPv6. (<i>without</i> relation
 *       to the JVM's overall protocol preference settings).
 *    </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The main method is 
 * {@link #getMostLikelyLocalInetAddress(IpAddressUtils.IpTypePreference) getMostLikelyLocalInetAddress()}.
 * The other methods essentially exist to provide input to this method but are
 * exposed nevertheless if anyone wants them.
 *  
 * <p>
 * These utility methods are in particular relevant in relation to
 * the PAC helper method {@code myIpAddress()}. However, the class may indeed 
 * be used for any use case.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note, that there is no single correct answer to the question about
 * determining the local host's IP address in an environment with multiple
 * network interfaces or multiple addresses on each network interface.
