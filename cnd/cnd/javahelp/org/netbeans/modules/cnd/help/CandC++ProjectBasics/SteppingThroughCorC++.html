<h2>Stepping Through Your C or C++ Program
</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>
Once execution of your program is halted, you can step through your
lines of code using the following commands on the Debug menu or
toolbar:
<ul>
<li><b>Step Over (F8) <img src="../images/Step_Over.gif" alt="Step Over button">.</b> Executes one source line or statement.
If the source line is a function call, executes the entire function
without stepping through the individual function instructions.
</li>
<li><b>Step Into (F7) <img src="../images/Step_Into.gif" alt="Step Into button">.</b> Executes one source line or statement.
If the source line is a function call, stops before the first
statement of the function.
</li>
<li><b>Step Out (Ctrl-F7) <img src="../images/Step_Out.gif" alt="Step Out button">.</b> Executes one source line or statement.
Finishes execution of the current function and stops on the source
line immediately following the call to that function.
</li>
<li><b>Step Into Last Function <img src="../images/Step_Into_Called.gif" alt="Step Into Called button">.</b> Attempts to step into the selected function, or if no function is selected,
into the last function called from the current source line
</li>
</ul>
