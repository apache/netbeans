  <p>
   Proposal of scenarios and UI to satisfy
   <a href="@TOP@/architecture-summary.html#answer-arch-usecases">usecases</a>
   for UI Gestures Collector.
  </p>
 </dd>
</dl>

<h1>Scenarios</h1>

<h3>Scenario: We need returning users</h3>

<p>
    Important user actions are recorded and remember in the system
    when the UI Gestures Collector is installed. In order for the gesture
    collector to be useful, it is necessary to convince the user to
    upload these information to our collecting server for processing.
    As we need a wide range of submittions, it is important that the 
    same user continous to submit these logs repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
    It is important to find the <q>right moment</q> for offering the user to do
    the upload. Current proposal counts with two options - when an exception
    occurs, the user is offered to send feedback to the server, also there
    is a UI button in the status bar that shall visually attract user attention
    and encourage him to submit the data.
</p>

<p>
    The range of "useful information" is wide and can be improved in future,
    however for purposes of this document it is enough to think about it
    just as an inteligent "Tip of the Day". Based on the submitted data and
    possibly the previous UI logs already submitted to the server, it
    is possible to select more appropriate "tip of the Day". In the simplest
    scenario it is definitely possible to find out what project types the
    user is using and not show tips about web projects, if it is writing just
    plain Java applications.
</p>

<p>
    By trading a useful information back for the user's submission of the UI Gestures
    data, we establish an equal and benefitial relationship with them and 
    encourage them to submit the data in future as well. It is believed
    that mutually benefitial approach supports returning customers.
</p>


<h3>Scenario: We need confident users</h3>

<p>
    Not all people like to sign bianco checks. Many of them 
    do not like to send information about themselves to someone
    else. We need to gain a certain amount of trust and convince them that
    sending data gathered by UI Gestures Collector is safe. Indeed one 
    way to built the trust up is the trading of useful information back as 
    described in previous chapter, however this starts to work only for subsequent
    submission, still we need to convince the user that first submission is safe.
</p>

<p>
    To do that the user will be given a chance to view and examine the content
    of the data to be submitted. The main submit screen will have a button to
    open a view of the logged data, the user will be able to browse thru them
    and then submit or cancel the transfer. There will be two views - one 
    human friendly - a list with records, icons, descriptions, etc.
    Second raw data - some kind of not very human readable XML
    in a text editor that represents the actual data to be sent to the logging
    server.
</p>

<h3>Scenario: We need to not scare newcommers</h3>

<p>
    The submission dialog shall not open too "early". Instead it shall
    wait for some time, to let the user try and see that the NetBeans
    based product is worth to use and it is worth to contribute to the
    project efforts.
</p>

<p>
    That is why there should be a limit of actions that the user has to
    perform before its attention is drawn to the process of submission.
    That is why there will be a toolbar button counting the actually
    performed user actions and if there will be more than 500 of actions
    the button will start to visually indicate that it should be pressed.
    If done, then the UI Gestures Collector dialog for submissions will
    open.
</p>

<h3>Scenario: We need reliable submissions</h3>

<p>
    We are not interested in logs from people who just play with the system
    (especially testers). We need real data and we need the data to be
    of the same quality - e.g. contain similar amount of information.
</p>

<p>
    This should be achieved the "action limit" of 500 described in previous
    section. If the user is encouraged to submit the logs after 500 actions,
    then most of the logs will contain data of the same size and as such
    they will be of similar level of value for analysis.
</p>

<h3>Scenario: Easy bug reports</h3>

<p>
    Easy bug reporting is critical to improving quality of any product.
    Many products include some "Dr." functionality that allows easy bug
    submission in case of failure. That is why it is expected that
    many users are going to see a failure as a natural moment for submitting
    a feedback to netbeans.org project. 
</p>

<p>
    The exception dialog will be enhanced to contain a submit button
    and open the UI Gestures Collector dialog.
</p>

<h1>Ascii Art</h1>

<h3>Submittion Button</h3>

<p>
    This button shall be placed in a status bar and shall encourage user to
    click on it and upload data to the server:
</p>

<pre>
/---\
|   |
\---/
</pre>
<p>
    The button visually indicates the growing 
    number of so far recorded events by being a "circle" with 
    an "arc" of already recorded actions from the expected
    maximum (currently 1000). 
</p>

<h3>Submittion Dialog</h3>

<p>
    This dialog appears when the user presses the button in status bar:

    When the user chooses to see the data about the be transfered to the server,
    then he will get following dialog. They are available in two forms, the 
    raw one is just one huge XML document which precisely describes the bits
    to be sent to the server. The Structured view splits the document to
    individual records:

<h3>Error Dialog</h3>

<p>
    When an exception is rised, its behaviour remains the same as is usual
    - e.g. in develpment builds to common "Unexpected Exception Dialog" is shown,
    in releases a blinking icon at the lower right corner starts to blink and
    when clicked the dialog is shown. However in contrast to previous versions,
    there is a new button <q>_R_eview and Report Problem</q> in the dialog. When clicked it 
    opens following dialog:
</p>

<p>
 User can fill his user name. After that we could contact him for more information,
 but this item is not needed, so he can check send report as a guest button.
 Issues from not registered users won't be so usefull, but better then nothing.
 Summary is going to be initially set to exception class and exception message, 
 if there is some, but we are giving user a possibility to change this item. 
 User can fill short description what has happen to him.
 After pressing Next button password is checked and report is send directly for 
 corect password. For wrong password "Username or password is wrong" message
 is shown and dialog stays enabled.
