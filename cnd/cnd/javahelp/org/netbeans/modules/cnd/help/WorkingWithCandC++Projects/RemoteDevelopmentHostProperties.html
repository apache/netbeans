       Setting Remote Host Properties

    <p>
       After you have configured a remote build host, you can set properties that specify how the
      IDE uses the host for C/C++/Fortran projects.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To set remote host properties:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open the Services window by choosing Window &gt; Services.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Services window, expand the C/C++ Build Hosts node.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right-click the remote host and choose Properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Host Properties dialog box, you can set the following properties:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Authentication.</b> Select Password to authenticate by entering a password, or SSH
            Key File to authenticate with an encryption key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Display Name.</b> To change the name displayed in the IDE for the host, type a new
            name in the Display Name field.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Access Project Files via.</b> To change the way project files are shared with the
            remote host, select the file access method from the list. If the project files are in a
            shared folder accessible from the local host and remote host, select System-level File
            Sharing. If sharing the files is not possible, select Automatic Copying to copy the
            files. The files are copied to your <tt>.netbeans</tt> directory on the remote host.
          </li>
          <li><b>Check ACL-based remote file permissions.</b> This option enables the IDE
              to recognize POSIX-style access control lists assigned to files. If you cannot access
              project files located on a remote server through the IDE even when Unix permissions
              are correct, try enabling this option.  Note that enabling it can cause significant slowdown if the
              system has broken automounts.  The option should only be enabled if the remote
              server is using POSIX-style ACLs.
</li>
          <li>
            <b>Enable X11 Forwarding.</b> If the projects you build on the remote host are graphical
            applications, select Enable X11 Forwarding. This allows you to run the application on
            the remote host, and have the windows shown on your local desktop.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       <b>To set a host as the default build host:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the Services window, expand the C/C++ Build Hosts node, right-click the host, and choose
        Set as Default. This host is used by default for new projects.
      </li>
    </ul>
