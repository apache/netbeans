/**
 * Utility class to help clients manage {@link Mode}s in order to layout TopComponents
 * in predefined "work-spaces".
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * In a NetBeans Platform application, a user may create various TopComponents and
 * drag them around, into and out of the existing defined Modes (e.g. editor, explorer) or 
 * new "anonymous" Modes which get created by the system as needed.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * The configuration of each Mode can be expressed in XML. This class gives access
 * to that XML. {@link WindowManager} provides a 
 * {@link WindowManager#createModeFromXml mechanism to reproduce a Mode from XML}
 * so you can construct ways to save Mode and TopComponent combinations, which can 
 * subsequently be chosen and reloaded at a later time.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * Note that this is a different approach to how the Platform tends to save the layout
 * of TopComponents at shut-down time in the Windows2Local file system. Note also that 
 * this is not connected with the deprecated notion of {@link Workspace}.
