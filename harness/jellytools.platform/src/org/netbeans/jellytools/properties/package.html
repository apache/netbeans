 Provides a set of classes for setting properties.
<p>  In the IDE properties settings happens through so called property sheets.
 Property sheet ({@link org.netbeans.jellytools.properties.PropertySheetOperator})
can be docked to any other window. Property sheet consists
of JTable with properties and optional description area. The table has two
columns showing property name and property value. Properties are grouped to
logical categories which can be collapsed or expanded when properties are
sorted by category. It is also possible to sort properties alphabetically (Sort
by Name).
Property value can be changed by inline editors (text field for string values,
check box for boolean values - {@link
org.netbeans.jellytools.properties.Property#setValue(String)} and combo box for list values
- {@link
org.netbeans.jellytools.properties.Property#setValue(int)}) or by custom editors
where they are available ({@link
org.netbeans.jellytools.properties.Property#openEditor}).
<P> 
 You can extend {@link org.netbeans.jellytools.properties.Property Property}, if 
you want to create your specific property. Some common properties are already 
created in this package (ColorProperty, PointProperty, ...).
</P>
 Properties can be used the following way:<br>
 
<pre>
        PropertySheetOperator pso = new PropertySheetOperator("Properties of MyClass");
        Property p = new Property(pso, "Name");
        System.out.println("\nProperty name="+p.getName());
        System.out.println("\nProperty value="+p.getValue());
        p.setValue("ANewValue");
        // set a new value by index where it is applicable
        //p.setValue(2);
        // open custom editor where it is applicable
        //p.openEditor();
</pre>

 Common custom editors are grouped in package {@link org.netbeans.jellytools.properties.editors 
editors}.<br>
