     * This implementation is a pull style implementation. So when
     * IOVisibility.setClosable() is called someone needs to trigger IOContainer
     * to re-pull this information. There is no API for triggering pulls.
     * <p>
     * Ironically we can make it work w/o a triggering API. The reason is that
     * whether the Tab has an X is controlled by
     * <code>
	putClientProperty(TabbedPaneFactory.NO_CLOSE_BUTTON, ! closable);
     * </code>
     * which doesn't need IOContainers involvement.
     * <br>
     * But that assumes that the container is implemented using NB TabedPaneFactory.
     * Alternative implementations will not benefit from this.
     * <p>
     * A better approach might be a "push" style where we introduce
     * IOContainer.setClosable() (using the usual capability enhancement technique).
     * <br>
     * However, Terminal implementation isn't very good yet at managing the
     * multiplexing of Terminal (aka IOTab) attributes (tooltip, actions etc).
     * So I'm postponing the push style until attribute multiplexing is under
     * control.
     * <p>
