<h2>Using Pair Completion, Smart Enter, and Smart Semicolons</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>
When you edit your C and C++ source files, the Source Editor does
"smart" matching of pair characters such as brackets, parentheses,
and quotation marks. When you type one of these characters, the
Source Editor automatically inserts the closing character. When you
type a semicolon (;), the semicolon is automatically inserted at
the end of the statement. If you type the closing character
yourself, the Source Editor removes the character it added
automatically, so the closing character is not duplicated.</p>
<p>
In addition, you can use the Shift-Enter keyboard shortcut to start a new line when the
insertion point rests before the closing pair character.
</p>
<p>
You can press Ctrl-Enter to split the current line at the insertion
point without moving the insertion point to the next line.
