Buddhabrot Fractal Demo

Description
-----------
        The Buddhabrot fractal set is a derivative of the popular Mandelbrot
        fractal set. Both sets iterated through the function f(z) = z2 + c,
        where z is a complex number. A Mandelbrot set is created by selecting
        points on the real-complex plane. A Buddhabrot set selects initial 
        points from the image region. Each pixel records its
        path until iterated result diverges. When the iterated result diverges,
        its final position is plotted on the canvas. The result reflects the
        traversal density of the pixel.

        Fractals were originally studied as mathematical objects. Besides
        their elegant mathematical and visual structure, their application
        in science and technology is what make fractals an important area of
        interest. For example, fractals are used in weather forecasting, 
        population and landscape ecology, financial modeling,  and bacterial 
        culture simulation. The demo uses fractals to demonstrate a 
        floating-point arithmetic intensive application.
