/**
 * Panel that changes its hight automatically if the components inside
 * it cannot fit in the current size. The panel checks and changes only its
 * height, not width. The panel changes not only height of its own but also
 * height of the toplevel <code>Window</code> it is embedded into. The size
 * change occurs only after this panel's children are <em>painted</em>.
 * <p>
 * This panel is supposed to be used as a replacement for a normal
 * <code>JPanel</code> if this panel contains a wrappable text and the panel
 * needs to be high enough so that all lines of the possibly wrapped text
 * can fit.
 * <p>
 * This class overrides method <code>paintChildren(Graphics)</code>.
 * If overriding this method in this subclasses of this class,
 * call <code>super.paintChildren(...)</code> so that the routine which performs
 * the size change is not skipped.
