        The JavaHelp integration API wraps the standard JavaHelp extension
        library. It also provides a small additional API for NetBeans modules to
        supply help sets to the system, add GUI menu items, and request that
        particular help topics be displayed.

            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions

        It only implements its own integration API. The JavaHelp reference
        implementation is bundled and that implements the JavaHelp API.

<!--
        <question id="compat-version">
            Can your module coexist with earlier and future
            versions of itself? Can you correctly read all old settings? Will future
            versions be able to read your current settings? Can you read
            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.

            The JavaHelp extension library (<samp>jh.jar</samp>) is included,
            currently at version 1.1.3.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note</strong> that some versions of Solaris ship with their
            own copy of this library in the location
            <samp>/usr/j2se/opt/javahelp/lib/jhall.jar</samp>. Since this JAR is
            included in the extensions path of the JRE on such machines, it would
            override the copy of <samp>jh.jar</samp> shipped with the NetBeans
            integration module. Normally this would be tolerable, but
            unfortunately the version shipped with Solaris is outdated and
            exhibits a number of serious bugs, especially in the handling of
            Japanese search text, which make the NetBeans help system unusable
            and which were fixed in subsequent official JavaHelp releases. (Note
            that search databases for JavaHelp help sets are often not cleanly
            usable in versions of JavaHelp other than the one in which they were
            built, since details of how HTML substring indices are calculated
            tend to be unstable between even minor releases.) To avoid such bugs,
            the NetBeans launcher checks for the existence of the abovementioned
            file, and if found, prepends the NetBeans <samp>jh.jar</samp> to the
            JVM's boot classpath. Other options were considered and rejected as
            unworkable.

        A singleton instance of <code>org.netbeans.api.javahelp.Help</code> is

    <answer id="perf-limit">
        When displaying help, all help sets need to be parsed by JavaHelp to
        determine the ID maps. For a large number of help sets, this might
        consume too much memory and CPU to be practical. Also when displaying
        "merged" help (the normal case), all help sets need to be merged
        together, which can also be time-consuming as their number grows.

        Menu items representing links to help topics are dynamically enabled or
        disabled. They are always enabled in case help sets have not yet been
        parsed, to avoid forcing a parse just to display the menu item; if
        selected at this time when there is no actual corresponding ID, they will
        do nothing. After help sets have been parsed, menu items referring to
        help topics which are actually available (the normal case) are enabled.
        In case a help topic is missing for some reason, the menu item is
        disabled.

    <answer id="perf-scale">
        Size of help set XML files (the map file especially) probably impacts
        parsing speed and memory consumption. Number of distinct help sets will
        probably impact performance as well. Exact numbers unknown, but JavaHelp
        appears to be pretty slow to parse and merge help sets.

    <answer id="perf-startup">
        Yes, it registers a global AWT window listener. This appears to be the
        only way to reliably tell whether a modal dialog is showing at a given
        time (and to receive notification when one is shown). There is a rather
        complex set of hacks to convert the help viewer into a nonmodal dialog
        and reparent it to an active modal dialog; otherwise it would be
        impossible to access help while a modal dialog was showing. There is an
        open request for AWT to support multiple application contexts, which
        would permit the help viewer to live in an independent context and not be
        blocked by modal dialogs used in NetBeans, but until this is fixed there
        is no known good solution to the modality problem.

            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called

            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered

        It uses <code>InstalledFileLocator</code> to implement the

            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources

        Not directly. It uses lookup to find help sets, while providing an XML
