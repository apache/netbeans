<h1><a name="overview">Overview and How to Test</a></h1>

<p>This document gives recommendations on how to organize I18N (localization)
of modules in the IDE or platform.</p>

<p>You will also want to see the

<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/intl/index.html">JDK I18N documentation</a>

(including the list of supported locales) for background information.</p>

<p>Japanese localization is a likely candidate for a
non-US-English locale, so if you are working heavily on I18N you probably
want an OS with Japanese support installed: fonts and so on. To test
localization, start the IDE with the <samp>-locale</samp> switch,
e.g.:</p>

<pre>
-locale ja
</pre>

<p>Or the JDK may predefine this information for you depending on the
host computer's native locale. Note that for this switch, language and
country and variant may be separated with a colon (<em>not</em>
underscore), e.g. <samp>ja:JP</samp>.</p>

<p>There should be no problem starting the IDE with a different locale than you did the last time; every label
you did not enter yourself should switch to the new locale. If you find a problem with localized strings
"sticking" in the user directory, file a bug with details to reproduce.</p>

<p>The bundle debugging mode (see below) is a great way for
localization teams, Quality Assurance, and developers to see exactly
how the IDE is dealing with localization. Many otherwise subtle
problems can be made apparent and easy to fix this way.</p>

<p>A complete I18N test plan should ideally check the result of
starting the IDE in Turkish locale - since in Turkish capital
<samp>I</samp> and lowercase <samp>i</samp> are <em>not</em> case
variants (they also differ in an accent mark: <samp>&#x0130;</samp> and <samp>&#x0131;</samp> are valid),
code which confuses
locale-sensitive and -insensitive operations is likely to display
errors in Turkish locale.</p>

<h1><a name="features">I18N Features</a></h1>

<p>Most of this document describes specific I18N features in NetBeans and
how they are intended to be used.</p>

<h2><a name="bundles">Bundle messages</a></h2>

<p>All message strings should be contained in a <samp>Bundle.properties</samp>
file (containing default message strings - i.e. in US English).
This resource bundle is conventionally in the same directory (package)
as the source files which use it; other source packages should have their
own bundles.
Localized (non-US-English) message strings should be inserted into a
<samp>Bundle_<i>LOCALE</i>.properties</samp> file - this file must
be placed in the same directory as the default bundle. For example,
<samp>Bundle.properties</samp> might have:</p>

<pre>
<i># A simple bundle key:</i>
LBL_some_text=Text in English for a button.
<i># A nicely formatted one:</i>
<i># {0} - number of missing files</i>
EXC_missing_files=There {0,choice,1#is one file|1#are {0,number,integer} files} missing.
</pre>

<p>In <samp>Bundle_cs.properties</samp>, however, there may be:</p>

<pre>
LBL_some_text=Text v \u010De\u0161tin\u011B na tla\u010D\u00EDtko.
EXC_missing_files=Chyb\u00ED {0,choice,1#jeden soubor|2#dva soubory|3#t\u0159i \
        soubory|4#\u010Dty\u0159i soubory|4#{0,number,integer} soubor\u016F}.
</pre>

<p>Remember that <strong>all non-ASCII characters</strong> present in
bundle files should be escaped in Unicode format
(<samp>\uXXXX</samp>). The <samp>native2ascii</samp> utility present
in the JDK can help with this.</p>

<p>Message strings are identified by keys and these are
entered in source files. These keys are non-localized strings.
The recommended way to use these in a source file is like this:</p>

<pre>
import org.openide.util.NbBundle;
<i>// Looks in Bundle.properties for LBL_some_text key:</i>
String localized = NbBundle.getMessage(ThisClass.class, "LBL_some_text");
<i>// Same, but formats the text as well:</i>
throw new IOException(NbBundle.getMessage(ThisClass.class, "EXC_missing_files",
                                          new Integer(missingFiles)));
</pre>

<!-- XXX talk about the Ant task instead? -->
<p>There is a script

<a href="https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master/nbbuild/misc/i18ncheck.pl"><code>nbbuild/misc/i18ncheck.pl</code></a>

which can help check for I18N violations - unlocalized strings. You
can run this script on source files just like a compiler: in fact,
from the IDE if run as an external compiler its error messages should
be hyperlinked. Standard constructions such as
<code>NbBundle.getMessage</code> are recognized as code which
retrieves localized text, so the bundle key itself does not trigger a
warning. But if the bundle key is on a different line, or if in
general you have a string literal in code which you know should never
be localized, then end that line of source code with a comment like
<b>//NOI18N</b>. This will indicate to the script that it should be
silently passed over.</p>

<p>Also the I18N module includes support for
finding I18N violations like this, and correcting them. There is a setting to use
<code>NbBundle.getMessage</code> as the localization device, which is
suited to module code.</p>

<h3><a name="bundle-debug">Bundle debugging</a></h3>

<p>It is possible to start the IDE with the special command-line option

<code>-J-Dorg.openide.util.NbBundle.DEBUG=true</code>

which enables a special bundle debugging mode. In this mode, any
string loaded from a bundle using the normal <code>NbBundle</code>
automatically include a special numeric annotation and line number in parentheses.
You can cross-reference the annotation to a indexed list, printed on the
console, of bundle locations that strings are
loaded from. (It only works when <code>NbBundle</code> is used, not plain <code>ResourceBundle</code>.)
This has several purposes:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Any text visible in the IDE not referring to something codelike
      (such as a method name or file name) which lacks this annotation
      can be noticed as being unlocalized and therefore corrected.</li>

  <li>Displayed text which is incorrect can be easily traced to the
      offending file and line and corrected.</li>

  <li>IDE features which <em>stop</em> working with this mode turned on
      might be found to be erroneously over-localized, i.e. use of
      localized messages in places where a hardcoded string is in
      fact required.</li>

</ol>

<p>Strings which are looked up in a localized hashtable are also
annotated with the key used to find them. Normally this would apply to
localizable strings taken from module manifests, such as the module
name.</p>

<p>Currently localized files (such as HTML pages which may be selected
by locale, or JavaHelp helpsets) are not annotated in any way.</p>

<h3><a name="bundle-recommendations">How to write good <samp>*.properties</samp> files</a></h3>

<p>There are some rules for how to write good <samp>*.properties</samp> files for easy
localization, starting with the most important.</p>

<ol>

  <li>Localizable messages should be stored in files named
  <samp>Bundle.properties</samp> by convention.</li>

  <li>If it is necessary to mix localizable and nonlocalizable messages
  in one <samp>Bundle.properties</samp> (to create groups of messages, where some of
  these messages are localizable and part not, and it is unreasonable to
  split off the unlocalizable ones): notate each nonlocalizable message with the preceding line
  <code>#NOI18N</code>. For example:
  <pre>
#NOI18N
var.POSSIBLE_FILE_STATUSES.value="Up-to-date", "Locally Modified", "Locally Added"
var.POSSIBLE_FILE_STATUSES_LOCALIZED.value="Up-to-date", "Locally Modified", \
        "Locally Added"
  </pre>

  In some cases it would be preferable to hardcode the unlocalizable messages in source to begin with.</li>

  <li>If there is <samp>*.properties</samp> file which must have a name different from the default
  and there are some localizable strings in it, the strings should be
  individually notated with <code>#I18N</code>. For example:
  <pre>
var.POSSIBLE_FILE_STATUSES.value="Up-to-date", "Locally Modified", "Locally Added"
#I18N
var.POSSIBLE_FILE_STATUSES_LOCALIZED.value="Up-to-date", "Locally Modified", \
        "Locally Added"
  </pre></li>

  <li>If (by the previous two cases) one message must be <em>partially</em> localized,
      
  the message should be annotated as
  <code>#PARTI18N</code> or <code>#PARTNOI18N</code> (above
  the message) indicating the exceptional part of the message. For example,
  in a properties file not named <samp>Bundle.properties</samp>:
  <pre>
#PARTI18N The module name
EXEC_CHECKOUT_MODULE=${RUN} ${QUOTE}${CVS_EXE}${QUOTE} ${USER_GLOBAL_PARAM} checkout \
      ${USER_PARAM(-N -R)} ${PROMPT_FOR[SELECTOR_MODULES](The module name)} ${NUR}
  </pre>
  Where there is more than one exceptional part, indicate them separated by commas, for example:
  <pre>
#PARTI18N Directory to export into, Date, The module name
EXEC_EXPORT_MODULE_DATE=${RUN} ${CD} ${PROMPT_FOR_DIR(Directory to export into)}&amp;&amp; \
      ${CVS_EXE} ${USER_GLOBAL_PARAM} export -D ${PROMPT_FOR_DATE_CVS(Date)} \
      ${USER_PARAM} ${PROMPT_FOR[SELECTOR_MODULES](The module name)} ${NUR}
  </pre>
  Analogously, for files named <samp>Bundle.properties</samp> with some nonlocalizable bits
  in some messages, use <code>#PARTNOI18N</code>.</li>

  <li>Use "&amp;" to denote mnemonic letter in text of <code>JLabel</code>s and buttons and
  set this text by calling <code>org.openide.awt.Mnemonics</code> helper method.
  This makes it easier to localize these texts together with assigned mnemonic.<br>
  If <code>org.openide.awt.Mnemonics</code> cannot be used (for example installer has no access
  to NetBeans API) then:
    <ul>
      <li>Always group label and mnemonic on adjacent lines
    in a property file (label on the first mnemonic on next)
      </li>
      <li>Never resuse a label or mnemonic. When a new
    mnemonic is added, create a new key/value pair. </li>
      <li>Mark mnemonic key by adding the suffix <strong>_Mnemonic</strong>> to the label key. </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<p>The bundle debugging mode (above) recognizes these conventions and
deals with them accordingly. For example, a message marked
<samp>#NOI18N</samp> in a file <samp>Bundle.properties</samp> will not
be annotated, though other messages in the same file will. Partial
localization of messages is not supported; the message will not be
annotated, and a warning will be printed on the IDE's console to
remind you.</p>

<p>When <em>changing the format</em> of a bundle value - for example, adding a
<samp>{0}</samp>-style parameter or removing one, or changing a pair of label and
mnemonic to just a label to be set with <code>org.openide.awt.Mnemonics</code> -
always <strong>create a fresh key</strong>. Otherwise it could happen that an
older localization could supply a value which is not of the correct form, causing
runtime errors. If you use a fresh key, the worst that can happen is that the
base locale value will be used; the localizers will notice the change of key name
when refreshing the localization and be able to confirm that they are using the
correct new format.</p>

<h2><a name="misc-i18nable">Other localized text (not in source code)</a></h2>

<p>There are files named <samp>README.html</samp> and <samp>LICENSE.txt</samp>
and localized versions should exist in the same directories:
by convention,
<samp>README_<i>LOCALE</i>.html</samp> and <samp>LICENSE_<i>LOCALE</i>.txt</samp>.
Similarly for other miscellaneous text.</p>

<p>Note that while bundle files should always use Unicode escapes and
not rely on the platform's encoding, HTML and XML files may specify
the desired encoding for their bodies using standard metainformational
tags, for example:</p>

<dl>

  <dt>XML</dt>
  <dd><samp>&lt;?xml&nbsp;version="1.0"&nbsp;encoding="UTF-8"&nbsp;?&gt;</samp></dd>

  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd><samp>&lt;meta&nbsp;http-equiv="Content-Type"&nbsp;content="text/html;&nbsp;charset=UTF-8"&gt;</samp></dd>

</dl>

<p>Of course you may always use numeric character entity escapes instead.</p>

<p>For textual files not used at runtime (such as licenses), please use UTF-8.</p>

<h2><a name="templates">Templates</a></h2>

<p>Templates can be localized too, if desired. Localized templates would have modified file contents (e.g. code
comments in a different language). The simplest way to localize template content is to use the
<code>nbresloc</code> URL protocol in the location of the content when specifying the template in the module's
XML layer.</p>

<h3><a name="template-descs">Template descriptions</a></h3>

<p>Most templates, especially frequently-used ones, should have template
descriptions. These are small blocks of HTML to be displayed to a user
in the New wizard giving an overview of what the template is
for. Descriptions should be HTML resources within the main module JAR; the API
Support module provides a convenient way of associating the
description to the template before packing the template JAR.</p>

<p>All templates should have localized description files, and the template file attributes in the localized JAR
should point to the localized descriptions; by convention, such descriptions should be named e.g.
<samp>SomeTemplateDescription_<i>LOCALE</i>.html</samp>. (It is <em>not</em> necessary to localize the
template's <em>contents</em> just to localize its description.) The URL used may be for example:</p>

<pre>nbresloc:/org/netbeans/modules/html/TemplateHelp.html</pre>

<p>where this URL loads the appropriate locale variant at
runtime. When doing this, the naming scheme for localized template
descriptions becomes a requirement rather than a convention.</p>

<h2><a name="loc-file-names">Localized file names</a></h2>

<p>The <em>system filesystem</em> is composed principally of files
installed by XML layers in enabled modules, sometimes modified by
overrides in the <samp>system/</samp> subdirectory of the user
directory. Sometimes these files are presented to the user: templates
under <samp>Templates/</samp>, for example, are displayed in the
<b>New</b> dialog.</p>

<p>In some cases the <em>contents</em> of the file suffice to provide
a pleasant localized name and icon to the user. For example,
<samp>*.instance</samp> files used to supply
<code>SystemAction</code>s need no special treatment: the action
itself provides a display name and icon.</p>

<p>In most cases, however, you will give the file itself a simple,
unlocalized name, and separately localize its display name.
(Technically: you are affecting the display name but not the name of
the data object's node delegate.) This is done with the file attribute
<code>SystemFileSystem.localizingBundle</code>, which gives the
abstract name of a resource bundle; in that bundle there should be a
key named according to the resource path of the virtual (layer) file
to be localized. Otherwise the raw file name is presented.
Additionally, <code>SystemFileSystem.icon</code> can give a 16x16 icon
to use instead of the default icon for that file type.
(<code>SystemFileSystem.icon32</code> is rarely used but can supply a
32x32 icon.)</p>

<p>Here then is an example of a module adding a menu with a bookmark,
and a template:</p>

<h2><a name="layers">Localizing layers</a></h2>

<p>
 XML layers themselves can be localized in the expected way: <samp>layer_<i>LOCALE</i>.xml</samp> can contain
 overrides of <samp>layer.xml</samp>. (You can add files or folders, or <q>mask</q> files or folders using
 special <samp>*_hidden</samp> files, or just replace layer file contents with a variant.) Localizing layers in
 this way is however quite rare and not nice to potential translators. Usually there is a better way, such as
 using a single fixed layer entry and looking up localizable text in a separate <samp>Bundle.properties</samp>.
</p>
<p>
 <a href="#branding">Branding</a> layers (see below) is however reasonably common, for example to hide unwanted
 menu items in an application based on the NetBeans Platform.
</p>

<h2><a name="images">Images</a></h2>

<p>Images which are localized should be saved as <samp>imageName_<i>LOCALE</i>.gif</samp> or
<samp>imageName_<i>LOCALE</i>.png</samp>. As usual, the localized image should be stored alongside that in the
default locale. The filenames of images should not be stored in <samp>Bundle.properties</samp> files, because
such files should be used for translatable text only. To access localized images, you may use
<code>Utilities.loadImage(path, true)</code>; or use URLs with the <code>nbresloc</code> protocol, which
accesses a resource by path (searching all enabled modules) considering also localized variants. Note that
automatic localization <em>will not</em> change the extension of the image file, so it is preferable to use PNG
format consistently in place of GIF, and name the base resource with the <samp>.png</samp> extension.</p>

<h2><a name="javahelp">Help documentation</a></h2>

<p>Help documentation should be localized according to the JavaHelp
specification.
The <samp>HelpSet.hs</samp> file should be localized as
<samp>HelpSet_<i>LOCALE</i>.hs</samp> and stored in the same package as the
default one.
Additionally, each <em>individual</em> file referred to by the help set (especially
HTML files) may be individually localized or not; URL links among the
files can point to the "base" version while in fact a localized (or
branded, see below) variant may be selected. Furthermore, cross-links
between files contained in different physical locations (directories
or JARs) are possible; the base URL for every document is considered
to be a resource path rather than a physical path. (Offline browsing
of such links will naturally not work as is.)</p>

<p>For example, using only a single helpset, ID map, and navigation
view files, all pointing to simple relative URLs, you can create a
file <samp>moreinfo.html</samp> as well as
<samp>moreinfo_f4j.html</samp>; the map (<samp>*.jhm</samp>) file as
well as other HTML files should simply point to e.g.
<samp>../moreinfo.html</samp>. When browsing offline, of course only
the base file will be visible. But when viewed in the IDE with
branding set to e.g. <code>f4j_ce</code>, then only
<samp>moreinfo_f4j.html</samp> will be displayed. This may be
convenient when most of a helpset is constant and only a couple of
files need to be branded or otherwise localized.</p>

<p>Note that XML files used by JavaHelp can specify a file encoding if
localized text is required in these files (helpset title, etc.).</p>

<h2><a name="module-metainfo">Module names</a></h2>

<p>
 Modules have several attributes which contain localizable text. They must be placed in a bundle file in the
 module, and this bundle must be referred to from the manifest, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
OpenIDE-Module-Localizing-Bundle: org/foo/mymodule/Bundle.properties
</pre>
<p>
 Here the file is automatically localizable, so e.g. <code>Bundle_ja.properties</code> would be used in Japanese
 locale.
</p>
<p>
 The bundle may contain the keys <code>OpenIDE-Module-Name</code>, <code>OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category</code>,
 <code>OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description</code>, and <code>OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description</code>.
</p>
<p>
 Also, the bundle debug mode (above) will display special annotations for localizable manifest-derived text.
</p>

<h1><a name="placement">Physical Placement of Localized Resources</a></h1>

<p>In the simplest case, localized resources may simply be placed
directly inside a module's JAR, distinguished only by their locale
suffixes in the resource path. For example, a single JAR might have
both default and Japanese bundles:</p>

<dl>
<dt><samp>jar:file:/netbeans/ide/modules/mymodule.jar!/com/me/mymod/Some.class</samp></dt>
<dd>(code referring to <samp>com.me.mymod.Bundle</samp>)</dd>
<dt><samp>jar:file:/netbeans/ide/modules/mymodule.jar!/com/me/mymod/Bundle.properties</samp></dt>
<dd><samp>Some_key=Some value in US English</samp></dd>
<dt><samp>jar:file:/netbeans/ide/modules/mymodule.jar!/com/me/mymod/Bundle_ja.properties</samp></dt>
<dd><samp>Some_key=\u540c\u671f\u5316</samp></dd>
</dl>

<p>Though simple, this system may be inconvenient for both users and
localizers: there is no way to quickly tell if you have resources for
a given locale available; no way to quickly remove unwanted locales;
updates to a single localization require patching the entire module;
and so on. For these reasons, NetBeans supports <em>splitting locale
variants</em> off from the main contents of a module. For example, the
module above could be stored as:</p>

<dl>
<dt><samp>jar:file:/netbeans/ide/modules/mymodule.jar!/com/me/mymod/Some.class</samp></dt>
<dd>(code referring to <samp>com.me.mymod.Bundle</samp>)</dd>
<dt><samp>jar:file:/netbeans/ide/modules/mymodule.jar!/com/me/mymod/Bundle.properties</samp></dt>
<dd><samp>Some_key=Some value in US English</samp></dd>
<dt><samp>jar:file:/netbeans/ide/modules/locale/mymodule_ja.jar!/com/me/mymod/Bundle_ja.properties</samp></dt>
<dd><samp>Some_key=\u540c\u671f\u5316</samp></dd>
</dl>

<p>The rule here is that resources specific to a non-default locale can
go into a separate JAR file, named according to the master JAR but
with an appropriate locale suffix, and placed in a subdirectory
<samp>locale</samp> below the position of the master JAR.
(<samp>/netbeans/ide/lib/locale/</samp> works too to localize libraries
present in <samp>/netbeans/ide/lib/</samp>, and similarly
<samp>/netbeans/ide/modules/ext/locale/</samp>, etc.) If you are using country
variants or branding (see below), you can analogously split off
multiple variants, such as
<samp>/netbeans/ide/modules/locale/mymodule_f4j_ce_ja.jar</samp>.</p>

<p>Remember that resources inside locale variants must still be
individually marked with locale suffixes! The presence of appropriate
locale variant JARs just tells the IDE to search these JARs in
addition to the master JAR, but the lookup is still ultimately
controlled by the resource names.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/projects/translatedfiles/index.html">NetBeans translation project</a>
normally creates these locale variants for modules included in the NetBeans
distribution.</p>

<p>There is no need to include a manifest in a locale variant JAR file. Any
manifest present will just be ignored. The name of the JAR alone suffices to
identify it.</p>

<p>Another feature of locale variants is that you can have a
<em>default locale variant</em> JAR. This just contains all
localizable resources for the module, in the default locale.
Analogously, it is stored in the <samp>locale</samp> subdirectory with
no suffix. For example:</p>

<dl>
<dt><samp>jar:file:/netbeans/ide/modules/mymodule.jar!/com/me/mymod/Some.class</samp></dt>
<dd>(code referring to <samp>com.me.mymod.Bundle</samp>)</dd>
<dt><samp>jar:file:/netbeans/ide/modules/locale/mymodule.jar!/com/me/mymod/Bundle.properties</samp></dt>
<dd><samp>Some_key=Some value in US English</samp></dd>
<dt><samp>jar:file:/netbeans/ide/modules/locale/mymodule_ja.jar!/com/me/mymod/Bundle_ja.properties</samp></dt>
<dd><samp>Some_key=\u540c\u671f\u5316</samp></dd>
</dl>

<p>This makes no difference to the IDE, it will continue to load and run
the JAR as before. But seeing all localizable resources split off this
way may be helpful to localizers, as it presents a compact summary of
what is and is not localizable in the module.</p>

<h1><a name="l10n-list">Lists of files to be localized</a></h1>

<p>In each module root directory there should be an
<samp>l10n.list</samp> file. This file should be kept up to date by
the module owner and consists of a list of file names which should be
localized or translated (HTML, <samp>*.properties</samp>, GIF images
and so on). There must be one line per file or pattern,
a path in the repository including the name of the module. Each
line must start with module name. A pattern can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><samp>**</samp> matches zero or more path segments of the name
  (e.g. <samp>**/*.class</samp> matches all <samp>.class</samp>
  files/dirs in a directory tree)</li>
  <li><samp>*</samp> matches zero or more characters of the name</li>
  <li><samp>?</samp> matches one character of the name</li>
</ul>

<p>Users of the Ant build tool will find the syntax familiar.</p>

<p>Example for <samp>form</samp> module:</p>
<pre>
form/src/org/netbeans/modules/form/Bundle.properties
form/src/org/netbeans/modules/form/actions/Bundle.properties
form/src/org/netbeans/modules/form/resources/AWTForms.html
form/src/org/netbeans/modules/form/resources/Application.html
</pre>

<p>An example using patterns:</p>
<pre>
form/**/Bundle.properties
form/src/org/netbeans/modules/form/resources/*.html
</pre>

<p>To more easily see which actual files which will be matched by a given pattern, just run:</p>

<pre>
ant -f nbbuild/build.xml display-l10n-list-matches
</pre>

<p>and enter a module name when prompted. If run inside NetBeans, you can also click on each match to open the
file.</p>

<h1><a name="branding">Branded Localization</a></h1>

<p>There is a special feature of <code>NbBundle</code> that permits
people making distributions of the IDE to conveniently "brand" it,
i.e. selectively replace a few prominent pieces of messaging,
images, and so on with specialized versions suited to their product or
distribution. Since in practice branding-related changes tend to be
structurally very similar to localization, the IDE permits developers
to brand items just as they would localize them.</p>

<p>Within the IDE, there are public methods in <code>NbBundle</code>
to examine and set the current "branding" (much like the default
locale) - but there is no need to use these directly. Instead, decide
on a branding token which will identify your brand. For example, Sun
may use a token such as <samp>f4jce</samp> when creating its Forte for
Java Community Edition (now Sun ONE Studio - a branded IDE based on NetBeans). Now you may
create branded resources exactly as you would localized resources. The
difference is that the search list for bundles and resources will
include your branding suffix. (This suffix comes before any
localization suffix, since it takes precedence over the localization
suffix - though it is unlikely this would ever matter.) For example,
in Japanese locale the search list for a bundle might look like this:</p>

<ol>

  <li><samp>/some/path/to/your/Bundle_f4jce_ja_JP.properties</samp></li>
  <li><samp>/some/path/to/your/Bundle_f4jce_ja.properties</samp></li>
  <li><samp>/some/path/to/your/Bundle_f4jce.properties</samp></li>
  <li><samp>/some/path/to/your/Bundle_ja_JP.properties</samp></li>
  <li><samp>/some/path/to/your/Bundle_ja.properties</samp></li>
  <li><samp>/some/path/to/your/Bundle.properties</samp></li>

</ol>

<p>As with all localizations, searches automatically fall back to
simpler resources if the specific locale plus branding was not found;
when using bundle files (with <code>NbBundle.getBundle</code> and
similar calls), there may be multiple matching bundles, in which case
any given key will be searched in all available bundles in order (so
that you can override only the keys you need). This makes it
convenient to brand the IDE by only <em>adding</em> files and not
<em>replacing</em> them - just as with localization. For example, a
given directory which supported both the <code>cs_CZ</code> locale and
the <code>yoyodyne</code> branding might have files such as these:</p>

<dl>

  <dt><samp>Bundle.properties</samp></dt>
  <dd><pre>
MSG_Welcome=Welcome to NetBeans!
LBL_boring_feature=Choose a color for your text.
</pre></dd>

  <dt><samp>Bundle_cs.properties</samp></dt>
  <dd><pre>
MSG_Welcome=V&#x00ED;t&#x00E1;me V&#x00E1;s v NetBeansu!
LBL_boring_feature=Vyberte si barvu pro sv&#x016F;j text.
</pre></dd>

  <dt><samp>Bundle_yoyodyne.properties</samp></dt>
  <dd><pre>
MSG_Welcome=Welcome to Yoyodyne HappyBuilder!
</pre></dd>

  <dt><samp>Bundle_yoyodyne_cs.properties</samp></dt>
  <dd><pre>
MSG_Welcome=V&#x00ED;t&#x00E1;me V&#x00E1;s v Yoyodynsk&#x00E9; Stavebni&#x010D;ce!
</pre></dd>

</dl>

<p>You may also provide a branding token
separated into segments with underscores. In this case, progressively
shorter substrings will be searched, just as for locales. For example,
in plain locale with branding <code>f4j_ce</code>, you would get the
search sequence:</p>

<ol>

  <li><samp>/some/path/to/your/Bundle_f4j_ce.properties</samp></li>
  <li><samp>/some/path/to/your/Bundle_f4j.properties</samp></li>
  <li><samp>/some/path/to/your/Bundle.properties</samp></li>

</ol>

<p>This permits for example a single "brand" to encompass multiple
"products", where some resources are product-specific and some apply
across products within a brand, while minimizing the number of
duplicated resources.</p>

<p>To run the IDE in a particular branding mode, use the
<samp>--branding</samp> startup switch, e.g.:</p>

<pre>
--branding yoyodyne
</pre>

<p>Since branding is generally used to provide product-specific overrides which ideally would live in a
different location than the base NetBeans product, you are permitted to place branding JARs in
parallel locations in other clusters. For example, if the NetBeans IDE lives in <samp>/opt/netbeans</samp> with
clusters like <samp>platform</samp> and <samp>ide</samp>, and then
<samp>/opt/netbeans/ide/modules/foo.jar</samp> may be branded by
<samp>/opt/product1/modules/locale/foo_brand.jar</samp> if you pass <samp>--branding&nbsp;brand</samp> and
<samp>/opt/product1</samp> is a cluster included in the NetBeans-based product.</p>
