/** Interface for SPI clients who want to affect searching mechanism for
 * available NavigatorPanel implementations.<p>
 * 
 * Navigator infrastructure searches for instance of this interface in
 * <a href="@org-openide-util@/org/openide/util/Utilities.html#actionsGlobalContext()">Utilities.actionsGlobalContext()</a>
 * lookup and then applies found policy on set of available 
 * <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorPanel.html">NavigatorPanel</a>
 * implementations.<p>
 * 
 * Note that multiple instances of this interface are not supported in
 * Utilities.actionsGlobalContext() lookup, one instance is chosen randomly
 * in this case.<p>
 * 
 * Common Usage: 
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>Implement this interface, return kind of policy that suits you from
 *          <code>getPanelsPolicy()</code> method.</li>
 *      <li>Put implementation instance into your TopComponent's subclass lookup,
 *          see <a href="@org-openide-windows@/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html#getLookup()">TopComponent.getLookup()</a>
 *          for details.</li>
 *      <li>Now when your TopComponent becomes active in the system, found
 *          panels policy is used to limit/affect set of available NavigatorPanel
 *          implementations.</li>
 *  </ul>
