<!--- 
  A file (resource) represents the MIME resolver input.
  The resource is tested on attributes obtained from lower layers (OS) such
  as extension, header bytes and wrapping <code>FileObject</code> attributes.
  Some of them must match to proceed to the <code>resolver</code> element.
  <p>
  Implementation Note: 
  Lower level MIME type is obtained by <code>FileUtil.getMIMEType()</code>. It may not be 
  retrieved by a call to <code>FileObject.getMIMEType</code> to avoid recursion. A better way
  to determine MIME type as assigned by the OS may be introduced in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
  Implementation Note: 
  All other tests are performed by calling appropriate methods on <code>FileObject</code>
  so there is a danger of recursion if these call <code>this.getMIMEType()</code>.
  </p>

<!ELEMENT file ((ext | mime | magic | fattr | pattern | name)+, (resolver | exit)) >

<!---
  Tests resource extension for full equality. If name attribute is empty string
  (name=""), it matches all files without extension.
-->
<!ELEMENT ext EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST ext name CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!---
  Tests resource MIME type for equality (RFC2045) or suffix equality if it 
  starts with '+' (RFC 3023). 
-->
<!ELEMENT mime EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST mime name CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--- 
  Look at initial bytes of the file and test for a complete match of masked
  bits. The default mask is the hexadecimal byte <samp>FF</samp> repeated as
  many times as the <code>hex</code> attribute is long.
  E.g. <samp>&lt;magic hex="0a0001" mask="FF00FF"/&gt;</samp>
-->
<!ELEMENT magic EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST magic hex CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST magic mask CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!---
  Test on <code>FileObject</code> attributes. Matching attributes are converted
  to strings via <code>Object.toString()</code> and compared to the <code>text</code>
  attribute.
  <p>
  <code>FileObject</code> attributes can be used for out-of-band tagging of standard documents.

<!---
  Search in the file for given pattern in given range. If there is an inner
  pattern element, it is used only if outer is fulfilled. Searching starts
  always from the beginning of the file. For example:
  <p>
  Pattern &lt;?php in first 255 bytes
  <pre>
    &lt;pattern value="&lt;?php" range="255"/&gt;
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
  Pattern &lt;HTML&gt; or &lt;html&gt; in first 255 bytes and pattern &lt;?php in first 4000 bytes.
  <pre>
    &lt;pattern value="&lt;HTML&gt;" range="255" ignorecase="true"&gt;
        &lt;pattern value="&lt;?php" range="4000"/&gt;
    &lt;/pattern&gt;
  </pre>
  </p>
-->
<!ELEMENT pattern (pattern?) >
<!-- Pattern to search for. It doesn't support wildcards or regular expressions. -->
<!ATTLIST pattern value CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!-- Range in bytes from beginning of the file. -->
<!ATTLIST pattern range CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!-- Whether search is case sensitive. By default it is case sensitive, i.e. ignorecase=false. -->
<!ATTLIST pattern ignorecase CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!---
  Compare filename with given name.
  For example:
  <p>
  Filename matches makefile, Makefile, MaKeFiLe, mymakefile, gnumakefile, makefile1, ....
  <pre>
    &lt;name name="makefile" substring="true"/&gt;
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
  Filename exactly matches rakefile or Rakefile.
  <pre>
    &lt;name name="rakefile" ignorecase="false"/&gt;
    &lt;name name="Rakefile" ignorecase="false"/&gt;
  </pre>
  </p>
-->
<!ELEMENT name EMPTY>
<!-- Filename to search for. It doesn't support wildcards or regular expressions. -->
<!ATTLIST name name CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!-- Whether to search for substring or exact match. Default is exact match, i.e. substring=false. -->
<!ATTLIST name substring CDATA #IMPLIED>
<!-- Whether search is case sensitive. By default it is case insensitive, i.e. ignorecase=true. -->
<!ATTLIST name ignorecase CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!---
  You may apply additional rules based on resource content.
  The <code>mime</code> element value is returned. Use the reserved value of <code>null</code>
  to indicate you are not interested in such files (same as <samp>&lt;exit/&gt;</samp>).

<!ATTLIST resolver mime CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!---
  Declares that this file is not recognized by this resolver. 
  A shortcut for <samp>&lt;resolver mime="null"/&gt;</samp>.
  For example:
  <p>
  Do not resolve *.txt files and do time consuming magic recognition only for not-txt files.
  <pre>
    &lt;file&gt;
      &lt;ext name="txt"/&gt;
      &lt;exit/&gt;
    &lt;/file&gt;
    &lt;file&gt;
