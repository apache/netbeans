OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=NetBeans IDE support for <a href="https://gradle.org">Gradle Build Tool</a>. \
 <p> \
 Gradle is an open-source build automation system that builds upon the concepts \
 of Apache Ant and Apache Maven and introduces a Groovy-based domain-specific \
 language (DSL) instead of the XML form used by Apache Maven for declaring the \
 project configuration. \
 Gradle uses a directed acyclic graph ("DAG") to determine the order in which \
 tasks can be run.<p>\
 Gradle was designed for multi-project builds, which can grow to be quite large. \
 It supports incremental builds by intelligently determining which parts of the \
 build tree are up to date; any task dependent only on those parts does not \
 need to be re-executed. <p> \
 The IDE support includes own project type entirely based on Maven's medatata, code completion for Maven's project files, integration with other tools in the IDE etc.
