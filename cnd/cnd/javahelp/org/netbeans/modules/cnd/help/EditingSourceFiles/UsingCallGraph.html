    <h2>
       Using the Call Graph
    </h2>
    <p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
    </p>
    <p>
       The Call Graph window displays two views of the calling relationships between the parts
      of your program. The left view is a hierarchical tree with expanding and collapsing nodes. The
      right view is a graphical view of the functions called from a selected function, or the
      functions that call that function. In addition, relationships between functions
      and variables are shown with dotted lines. The two views are synchronized.
    </p>
    <p>The starting point of a call graph can be a function, variable, or field.
    Each element in the Call Graph is marked with an <a href="Icons.html">icon</a> to identify its type.</p>
    <p>
       <b>To open the Call Graph:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the Source Editor, right-click on a function, variable, or field, and choose Show Call Graph.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Call Graph window opens and displays the tree of functions called by the selected
        function, or the function that contains the selected variable or field.
      </li>
      <li>
        The left panel shows a tree with the item that was originally selected at the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        The right panel shows a graphical view of the selected function and its callers and callees,
        or other selected item and associated function.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>To use the Call Graph:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Expand nodes in the left panel to expand the callers and callees in the graphic panel.</li>
      <li>
        Right-click a function in the Call Graph graphic window and select Expand Callees to add to
        the call graph all the functions that the selected function calls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right-click any function and select Expand Callers to add the functions that call the
        selected function.
      </li>
      <li>
        Double-click a function to jump to the source file where the function is declared. You can
        also right-click the function and select Go to Declaration to jump to the source file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Save a PNG image of the call graph by right-clicking anywhere in the Call Graph window and
        selecting Export.
      </li>
      <li>Export the call graph to a GraphML XML file by right-clicking anywhere in the Call Graph window and
        selecting Export as XML.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       Buttons at the left side of the Call Graph window allow you to change the display of the
      call tree nodes and graph.
