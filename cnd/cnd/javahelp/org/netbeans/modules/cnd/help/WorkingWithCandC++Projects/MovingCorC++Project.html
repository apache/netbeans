<h2>Moving, Copying, or Renaming a C or C++ Project</h2>
<p>When you create a project, the IDE bases much of its project metadata
on the name and location of the project. These values are used in the project
properties, and the names and locations of the project folders. In order to safely move,
copy, and rename a project, you must use the commands provided by the IDE.
</p>
<p><b>To move, copy, or rename a project:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
Right-click the project's node in the Projects window and choose one of the
following commands:
<ul>
<li>Rename Project</li>
<li>Move Project</li>
<li>Copy Project</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Moving and renaming a project can break dependencies between projects. To fix the
project dependencies, remove the renamed or moved projects from the required
projects for any other projects, and then add them again.
