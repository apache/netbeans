</head>
<body>
<h2>Resolve Missing Native Build Tools Dialog Box</h2>

<p>If the tools required to build the project are not in the
collection specified for the project, the
Resolve Missing Native Build Tools dialog box opens.</p>
<p>
To resolve the missing build tools, you can set the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Build Host.</b> The Build Host drop-down list includes
your local host and any remote hosts you have defined. For information
on using remote hosts, see <a href="../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/RemoteDevelopment.html">Remote Development</a>.
You can add and remove
remote build hosts, change the default host, and share project sources
on the local host with the remote host.
<ul>
<li>To add a remote host, click Edit. In the Build Hosts Manager
dialog box, click Add. In the Add New Server dialog box, type the
name of the host in the Build Server field. Change
the default Login name if needed. Type your password
in the Password field and click OK.
</li>
<li>To remove a remote host, click Edit. In the Build Hosts Manager
dialog box, select the host you want to remove, click Remove, then click OK.
</li>
<li>To set a host as the default build host, select the host
from the Build Host drop-down list.
</li>
<li>To map the project sources on the local host to a remote host,
click Path Mapper. In the Edit Path's Map dialog box, select the
remote host in the Host drop-down list. For each mapping, type
the local path to project sources in the Local Path field and the
corresponding remote path in the Remote Path field.
</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Tool Collection.</b> The tool collection list displays
the collections found on the current build host and the local
host. The default
collection is listed in bold type. For the local host, you can modify
the list by adding or removing collections.
<ul>
<li>To add a collection to the list, click Add and specify the
base directory in the Add New Tool Collection dialog box. The Tool Collection
Family and Tool Collection Name are filled in automatically. You can specify
a different name for the collection. If you change the family,
make sure that the family you specify is the correct family for the
collection or the compiler flags might not be valid.
</li>
<li>To remove a collection from the list, select the collection and
click Remove.
</li>
<li>To duplicate a collection, select the collection from the list
and modify the base directory, tool collection family, or tool collection name in
the dialog box.
</li>
<li>To make a collection the default, select the collection and
click Default.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Base Directory.</b> The base directory where the compilers are located on
the current build host. The base directory is typically a <tt>bin</tt>
directory. To change the base directory,
click the browse button and select a new directory.
These fields can be edited for the local host 
but not for remote hosts.  For a remote build host, you must enter the
full path to the tools on the remote host.
<p>For each tool, the default command is the first one found in the
base directory. To select a different command from the base directory
or another directory, click the browse button and navigate to a different
command in the Select Tool dialog box.</p></li>
<ul>
<li><b>C Compiler.</b> The C compiler command to use for building C projects.
</li>
<li><b>C++ Compiler.</b> The C++ compiler command to use for building C++ projects.
</li>
<li><b>Fortran Compiler.</b> The Fortran compiler command to use for building Fortran projects.
</li>
<li><b>Assembler.</b> The assembler program command to use for projects in assembly code.
</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Make Command.</b> The make command to use for building projects. 
</li>
<li><b>Debugger Command.</b> The gdb command to use when debugging projects.  
</li>
<li><b>QMake Command.</b> The command for generating makefiles from qmake <tt>.pro</tt> project files.</li>
<li><b>CMake Command.</b> The command for generating makefies from <tt>CMakeLists.txt</tt> configuration files.</li>
</ul>
