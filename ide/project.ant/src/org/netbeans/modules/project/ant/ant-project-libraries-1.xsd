Schema for references to versionable library descriptors. See #44035.
Since: org.netbeans.modules.project.ant/1 1.18
Include as a fragment in an nbproject/project.xml file.
Content of a <definitions> element is a relative path to a properties file.
('/'- or '\'-separated but NOT in URI syntax, e.g. do not encode spaces as %20.)
The path is resolved against the project's base directory.
The property values that are recognized are of the form libs.NAME.KEY
where NAME is the (internal) name of a library,
and KEY is one of the following (refer to http://www.netbeans.org/dtds/library-declaration-1_0.dtd for comparisons):
1. 'type' - e.g. 'j2me', as in <library>/<type>; default is 'j2se'
2. 'name' - e.g. 'My Library', as in <name> (localizing bundles not supported); default is internal name
3. 'description' - e.g. 'Some library of mine.', as in <description>; default is null
4. 'classpath', 'src', 'javadoc', etc. - according to the <volume>/<type>, as in $userdir/build.properties
Volume-typed values should be paths (separated with ':' or ';') of file or folder names (usually relative).
The special token '${base}' may be used to refer to the directory in which the properties file resides.
For a definitions file PATH.properties, there may also be a file PATH-private.properties
which can override or supplement its definitions (typically with absolute filenames).
