</head>
<body>
<h2>New C/C++ Static Library Wizard: Name and Location</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>The New C/C++ Static Library wizard enables you to create a new C or C++
static library.</p>
<p>In the Name and Location page, you have to set the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>Project Name.</b> Specifies the display name of the project.
This name is also used to create the project folder.
</li>
<li><b>Project Location.</b> Specifies the folder where you want to store the
project metadata and source code. When you create an empty C or C++ project, you
cannot store the project folder and project source code in separate locations like
you can with projects based on existing makefiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also set the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>Project Makefile Name.</b> You can change the default name of the project makefile.
If a makefile already exists in the project folder, the default name is Makefile-<i>project</i>.mk; otherwise,
the default name is Makefile.</li>
<li><b>Build Host.</b> You can select the local host or a remote build host
that you have previously set up. The project will be built and run on the selected build host.</li>
<li><b>Tool Collection.</b> You can select a tool collection that has been previously configured for the selected build host.
The tool collection will be used to build and run the project.</li>
</ul>
