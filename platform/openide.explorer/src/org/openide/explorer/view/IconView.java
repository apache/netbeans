/** A view displaying {@link Node}s as icons.
 * <p>
 * This class is a <em>view</em>
 * to use it properly you need to add it into a component which implements
 * {@link org.openide.explorer.ExplorerManager.Provider}. Good examples of that can be found 
 * in {@link ExplorerUtils}. Then just use 
 * {@link org.openide.explorer.ExplorerManager.Provider#getExplorerManager} call to get the {@link ExplorerManager}
 * and control its state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There can be multiple <em>views</em> under one container implementing {@link org.openide.explorer.ExplorerManager.Provider}. Select from
 * range of predefined ones or write your own:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *      <li>{@link org.openide.explorer.view.BeanTreeView} - shows a tree of nodes</li>
 *      <li>{@link org.openide.explorer.view.ContextTreeView} - shows a tree of nodes without leaf nodes</li>
 *      <li>{@link org.openide.explorer.view.ListView} - shows a list of nodes</li>
 *      <li>{@link org.openide.explorer.view.IconView} - shows a rows of nodes with bigger icons</li>
 *      <li>{@link org.openide.explorer.view.ChoiceView} - creates a combo box based on the explored nodes</li>
 *      <li>{@link org.openide.explorer.view.TreeTableView} - shows tree of nodes together with a set of their {@link org.openide.nodes.Node.Property}</li>
 *      <li>{@link org.openide.explorer.view.MenuView} - can create a {@link JMenu} structure based on structure of {@link Node}s</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All of these views use {@link ExplorerManager#find} to walk up the AWT hierarchy and locate the
 * {@link ExplorerManager} to use as a controler. They attach as listeners to
 * it and also call its setter methods to update the shared state based on the
 * user action. Not all views make sence together, but for example
 * {@link org.openide.explorer.view.ContextTreeView} and {@link org.openide.explorer.view.ListView} were designed to complement
 * themselves and behaves like windows explorer. The {@link org.openide.explorer.propertysheet.PropertySheetView}
 * for example should be able to work with any other view.
 * </p>
