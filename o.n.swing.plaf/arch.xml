    <answer id="arch-what">
	The plaf library consists primarily of code that used to be in core.  What it does:
        <ul>
	<li>Installs a custom look and feel if a custom look and feel class is passed to it</li>
        <li>Sets the correct fonts in the Swing UIDefaults if a custom fontsize is desired for the application's UI</li>
        <li>Loads a UI theme if a URL for the theme file (no format changes since NetBeans 3.4) is passed to it</li>
        <li>Installs custom UI keys and values used by other components of NetBeans, such as colors and UI delegate class names used by
   	    other parts NetBeans.  Examples of these:
             <ul>
               <li>Tab control UI delegate class name, depending on the look and feel, for the window system</li>
               <li>Definitions of colors which the tab control, property sheet and output window will use, if present in
                   UIDefaults, to color themselves in accordance with the UI spec for them on a given look and feel</li>
               <li>Custom border implementations NetBeans uses for scroll panes to reduce &quot;border-buildup&quot;</li>
               <li>A custom implementation of ToolbarUI which NetBeans uses for its toolbars, and a custom UI for 
                   toolbar buttons which sizes them correctly (GTK and Aqua only, currently)</li>
               <li>Insets definition for the editor scrollbar, used to get the height of the upper and lower button of the scrollbar
                   for purposes of the Error Stripe. The appropriate key value is "Nb.Editor.ErrorStripe.ScrollBar.Insets".
               </li>
             </ul>
         </li>
         <li>Compensate for missing elements on some (GTK) look and feels, which standard Swing code expects to be
             present, i.e. UIManager.getColor (&quot;control&quot;), to enable older code to run unmodified on newer
             look and feels.</li>
         </ul>
    

    Its API consists of a single method, org.netbeans.swing.plaf.Startup.run (Class lookAndFeel, int fontSize, URL themeFile),
    which should be called early in NetBeans startup sequence by core, to initialize UIDefaults values before any main window
    GUI is constructed.  It provides a minimal SPI in the form of the abstract class LFCustoms, which an alternate look and
    feel could use to provide lists of keys and values which should be installed into UIDefaults, via the mechanism documented
    in the documentation for LFCustoms.

            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number

            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used

            </hint>
        </question>
-->
    <answer id="deploy-packages">
        No.  There is one root package containing the API, and several per-look-and-feel packages
        containing implementations of standard Swing UI delegates (such as a custom toolbar UI for
        Aqua and GTK look and feels), and custom implementations of Border and such.  Swing's mechanism
        for loading a UI delegate is by fetching the UI class name from UIDefaults and creating an 
        instance of that class, so the UI delegates must be publicly accessible for Swing to be able
        to load them.

            Installation location shall not matter, if it does explain why.

        </question>
-->
    <answer id="deploy-shared">
        It is a library, not a module, because its code must run very early in the startup sequence,
        before other GUI is constructed, so that all GUIs will have the correct colors, borders, UI
        delegates, etc.  All of this was formerly done directly in core.

            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an
            API as well.

        For testing purposes only, the system property &quot;nb.forceui&quot; can be used to
        load NetBeans customizations for a different look and feel (such as loading the custom
        Aqua UI delegates on Windows).  The only purpose for this flag is to enable 
        development/bug fixing and minimal testing when a developer is working on a machine

            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example
            using <code>RequestProcessor</code>), definitively it should 
            not block AWT thread.

        <question id="resources-file">
            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?

            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.

<!--
        <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create any files or
            folders in it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            components?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.

            Check for cases when you have an object of type A and you also
            expect it to (possibly) be of type B and do some special action. That
            should be documented. The same applies on operations in meta-level
