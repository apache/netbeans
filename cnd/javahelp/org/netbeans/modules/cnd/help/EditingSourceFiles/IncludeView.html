<h2>Using the Include Hierarchy Window</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Include Hierarchy window lets you inspect all header and source files that are directly
or indirectly included in a source file, or all source and header files that
directly or indirectly include a header file.</p>
<p><b>To open the Include Hierarchy window:</b>
<ol>
<li>Open the source or header file.
<li>In the Source Editor, do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>To show the include hierarchy for the file, right-click anywhere
in the file. </li>
<li>To show the include hierarchy for a file that is included via a <tt>#include</tt> directive,
click on the directive.
</li>
</ul>
<li>To display the include hierarchy, choose Navigate &gt; View Includes Hierarchy.
    The Hierarchy window opens to the right of
Source Editor window.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a source file, the default hierarchy display is a plain list of all directly
and indirectly included files. For a header file, the default hierarchy display is a plain list of files
that directly include the header file. For an included file, the
default hierarchy is a plain list of
the files that directly or indirectly include the file.
</p>
<p>Buttons at the bottom of the Include Hierarchy window allow you to
change the display:
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="The left column lists
the button. The right column lists the description.">
<tr valign="top">
<th scope="col" align="left">Button</th>
<th scope="col" align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="../images/refresh.png" alt="Refresh button"></td>
<td>Updates the hierarchy display.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../images/who_includes.png" alt="Who Includes This File button"></td>
<td>Changes the list to the files
that include the file (the default view for header files).</td>
</tr>
<tr>

files that are included in the file (the default view for source files).</td>

include or are included, and the list of all files that include or are included.
