 BUILD OUTPUT DESCRIPTION\n\
 ========================\n\
 \n\
 When you build an Java application project that has a main class, the IDE\n\
 automatically copies all of the JAR\n\
 files on the project's classpath to your project's dist/lib folder. The IDE\n\
 also adds each of the JAR files to the Class-Path element in the application\n\
 JAR file's manifest file (MANIFEST.MF).\n\
 \n\
 To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and\n\
 type the following:\n\
 \n\
 java -jar '"{0}'" \n\
 \n\
 To distribute this project, zip up the dist folder (including the lib folder)\n\
 and distribute the ZIP file.\n\
 \n\
 Notes:\n\
 \n\
 * If two JAR files on the project classpath have the same name, only the first\n\
 JAR file is copied to the lib folder.\n\
 * Only JAR files are copied to the lib folder.\n\
If the classpath contains other types of files or folders, these files (folders)\n\
 are not copied.\n\
 * If a library on the project's classpath also has a Class-Path element\n\
 specified in the manifest,the content of the Class-Path element has to be on\n\
 the project's runtime path.\n\
 * To set a main class in a standard Java project, right-click the project node\n\
 in the Projects window and choose Properties. Then click Run and enter the\n\
 class name in the Main Class field. Alternatively, you can manually type the\n\
 class name in the manifest Main-Class element.
