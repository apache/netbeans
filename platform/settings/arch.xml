            <hint>
            Please provide here few lines describing the the project,
            what problem it should solve, provide links to documentation,

<answer id="arch-what">
Settings are persistent objects with a set of properties, that should be available via lookup.  
Properties are expected to be changed. Implementation of setting doesn't care about persistence issues, which
is responsibility of settings infrastructure.  XML persistence support is provided in a standalone autoload module core-settings.jar.
Also service types must be mentioned here.
Service type can be desribed as typed a named settings.

            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.

<code>ServiceType</code> is publicly accessible.

<answer id="exec-privateaccess">
There are method invocations between parts of setting infrastructure.
<ul>
<li>
If there is created new persistent instance of setting object in the runtime, 
then <code>InstanceDataObject</code> that comes from <samp>openide.jar</samp>, calls 
method responsible for storing setting on disk. This method is expected to have 
following decaration <code>public void methodName (java.io.Writer w, Object inst)</code>. Which
method and from which module is invoked depends on configuration. 
</li>
<li>
If new persistent instances of setting was created, then infrastructure must be notified about it, to be able to listen
on changes and ensure , that all changes will be stored. Then from <code>InstanceDataObject</code>
is used  <code>Lookup</code> to find <code>InstanceCookie</code>. Then method <code>setInstance</code>
is invoked on instance of <code>InstanceCookie</code>. This binds instance of setting to setting infrastructure.
Which <code>Lookup</code> and then also which <code>InstanceCookie</code> is used depends again on cofiguration.

Yes reflection is used heavily.

     <question id="perf-progress">
            Does your module execute any long-running tasks?
            <hint>Typically they are tasks like connecting over
            network, computing huge amount of data, compilation.
            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example
            using <code>RequestProcessor</code>), definitively it should 
            not block AWT thread.

<answer id="perf-progress">
No. Perhaps if ToolsOption is showed, then createing of nodes defined 
in UI/Services may take relatively enough time, but not sure if this should be
considered as part of setting infrastructure.

     <question id="perf-scale">
            Which external criteria influence the performance of your
            program (size of file in editor, number of files in menu, 
            in source directory, etc.) and how well your code scales?
            Please include some estimates.

Not completely relevant questin in this case. There is not  so much important how many settings will be defined,
but how heavily will be used.

            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.

     <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create any files or

            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

     <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resources provided by other modules in
            their layers?
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

Yes <samp>core-settings.jar</samp> override <samp>xml/lookup/Netbeans/DTD_Session_settings_1_0.instance</samp> in
