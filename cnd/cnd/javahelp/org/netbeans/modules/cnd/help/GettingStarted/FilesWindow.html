       The Files window shows a directory-based view of your projects, including files and folders
      that are not displayed in the Projects window. You can open the Files window by choosing
      Window &gt; Files (Ctrl-2).

    <p>
       For C and C++ projects, the Files window displays the following:

          <p>The directory that holds properties that are defined for you only. If you are sharing the
          project over VCS, any properties you define in <tt>private.properties</tt> are not
          checked in with other project metadata and are applied only to your installation of the
          IDE.</p>
          <p>The private directory contains a <tt>launcher.properties</tt> file
            which enables you to create "launchers" so you can easily run your project from the
            project context menu with different arguments, for example, or launch it from a script.

          Oracle Solaris operating system on an x86 system, you will have Debug and
          OracleDeveloperStudio-Solaris-x86 subdirectories. These subdirectories enable you to keep
          separate build products for different build environments.
