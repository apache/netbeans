       Qt is an open source multi-platform framework for developing C++ applications. Qt is
      especially useful for GUI applications. Before you can work with Qt projects, you must
      download the Qt libraries for your Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X platform from
      <b>http://qt.io</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
       If you are using a Solaris platform, you must build the Qt libraries from sources that you
      can get from <b>http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt</b> site.
    </p>
    <p>
       The IDE supports creating, building, running, and debugging of Qt projects without leaving
      the IDE. You can create Qt applications without complex project configuration and
      hand-editing of Makefiles.
    </p>
    <p>
       Typical Qt files, such as forms, resources, and translations, can be easily created from
      inside the IDE in the standard ways when working with C/C++ projects. When the project is a
      Qt project, you see additional file types for Qt. To create the files, the IDE opens standard
      Qt editing tools: Qt Designer for form files and Qt Linguist for translations. Qt tools such
      as qmake, moc, and uic are launched automatically as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
       Code Assistance is configured automatically if the IDE can find a Qt installation on your
      computer. When you open project properties on a Qt project, you can set Qt-specific project
      properties which cover typical configuration needs, and also allow experts to fine-tune the
      generated qmake project file.
