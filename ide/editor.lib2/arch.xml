    The Editor Library 2 module is a set of official APIs and SPIs, designed to 
    replaces the original Editor Library with legacy APIs
    that are not properly structured and do not conform to the rules
    implied on the current NB APIs.

    The migration process from the old APIs in Editor Library to the new ones
    in Editor Library 2 is a long task without any clear time frame. We will

            <hint>Typically they are tasks like connecting over
            network, computing huge amount of data, compilation.
            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example

            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when

<!-- Question: resources-layer

     <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create some files or

            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

        <question id="exec-threading" when="impl">
            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to?
            <hint>
                If your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
                Also describe when any events are fired: synchronously, asynchronously, etc.

            How the performance of the plugged in code will be enforced?

            If you allow foreign code to be plugged into your own module, how
            do you enforce, that it will behave correctly and fast and will not

<answer id="perf-spi">
    The infrastructure does not enforce any performance criteria and it's up to
    modules to perform reasonably. On the other hand each SPI defines its threading
    and locking model, which should help modules to understand the constraints
    and impact of their code.
