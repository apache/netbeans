    <h1>Error Stripe Provider How To</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>First of all, decide which information should be shown in the Error Stripe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Error-like annotation</strong>, for example compile errors, warnings, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Up-to-date status</strong> used to switch off the global status if the file is currently
            not parsed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Error Like Annotation</h2>

    <p>Extend the particular annotation type with <code>severity</code>, <code>custom_sidebar_color</code>
       and <code>priority</code> attributes as described in
       <a href="@org-openide-text@/org/openide/text/doc-files/api.html#auto-ann">the Editor API</a>.</p>

    <h2>Up-to-date Status</h2>

    <p>To influence the global status type (up-to-date/processing/dirty), implement
       <a href="UpToDateStatusProvider.html">UpToDateStatusProvider</a> returning the <a href="UpToDateStatus.html">UpToDateStatus</a>
       and firing change events, and <a href="UpToDateStatusProviderFactory.html">UpToDateStatusProviderFactory</a>.</p>
