/**
 * This interface should be implemented by anyone who whats to provide hyperlinking
 * functionality in the source code.
 * <br>
 * There should be one provider instance per mime-type.
 * Its methods are called for all the opened editors of the given mime-type
 * where the hyperlinking functionality gets requested.
 *
 * <p>
 * The providers need to be registered.
 * For NetBeans IDE, the default approach is to use System FileSystem.
 * <br>
 * The HyperlinkProvider(s) should be registered as ".instance" objects under
 * <code>Editors/&lt;mime-type&gt;/HyperlinkProviders</code> directory.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Please see {@code org.netbeans.lib.editor.hyperlink.spi.HyperlinkProviderManager}
 * for more details.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: there is no assurance on the order of calling of the methods in this class.
 * The callers may call the methods in any order and even do not call some of these methods
 * at all.
