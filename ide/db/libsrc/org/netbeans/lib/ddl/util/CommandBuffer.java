/**
* Command buffer used to execute a bunch of commands. Main advantages of using
* buffer is:
* - Optimized connection handling. Buffer opens JDBC connection before executing
* of first command and closes it after a last one. It's safely then manually
* handling connection and better then leaving commands open and close connection
* for each command separately.
* - Exception handler. You can assign an exception handler to buffer. When any
* error occures during the execution, this handler catches it and lets user to
* decide if continue or not (when you're dropping nonexisting table, you probably
* would like to continue).
* - Debgging. You can set up debug mode and buffer will print each command to
* System.out before execution.
