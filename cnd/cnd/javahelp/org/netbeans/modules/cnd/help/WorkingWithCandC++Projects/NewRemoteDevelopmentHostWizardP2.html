    <ul>
<li><b>Identification.</b> In the Login field, enter the user name that you use to log in to the remote host.
    </li>
    <li><b>Authentication.</b> Select a method for authenticating
        to the host.
    <ul>
<li><b>Password.</b> Select this option to be prompted to enter your password
        when the IDE connects to the host.</li>
    <li><b>SSH Key File.</b> Select this option to use a authentication key to connect to the host.
    The keypair must already have been set up appropriately on the local client and remote host before
    the IDE can use the SSH private key. You can browse to the location where the keys are stored and select the private
    key you want to use.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Automatically Find Compilers and Tools.</b> The IDE searches your path for a tool
    collection on the remote host. If you prefer to add a tool collection manually later, you can deselect this
    option. This can save time in setting up a remote host. </li>
    <li><b>Check ACL-based remote file permissions.</b> This option enables the IDE
              to recognize POSIX-style access control list permissions on files. Note that enabling
              it can cause significant slowdown if the
              system has broken automounts.  The option should only be enabled if the remote
              server is using POSIX-style ACLs.
</li>
</ul>
    <p>Click Next.</p>
    <p>If you selected Password, you are prompted to enter your password. If you selected
        SSH key, you might be asked to confirm the RSA key fingerprint of the server if this
        is the first time you have connected to the server using the key.</p>

    <p>The IDE connects to the remote host,
    determines the host's platform, and searches for tool collections on your path on the remote host.
    When this process is complete, the <a href="NewRemoteDevelopmentHostWizardP3.html">Summary page</a>
    is displayed.</p>
