# Use fully qualified names, one class per line. Syntax is:
#   qualified.name=value    : value will be used instead of qualified name.
#   [prefix.]qualified.name : the prefix will be stripped
#   [prefix=subst]          : the prefix in all classes will be replaced by subst, possibly empty
#   * as the first character: watch for changes in this interface, fire changes.
# Names will be converted to "class:<name>" tokens.
