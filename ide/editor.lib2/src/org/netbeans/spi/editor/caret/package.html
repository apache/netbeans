  <p>
  The Editor Caret SPI contains interface(s) to be implemented by clients
  in order to manipulate the editor carets.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Key parts of the SPI</h3>
  
  <p>
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/spi/editor/caret/CaretMoveHandler.html">CaretMoveHandler</a></code>
  allows to implement a transaction that will move individual carets or change their selections.
  <br>
  The following code shows how all carets are moved to the
  end of the word they are currently on.  
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code>
    editorCaret.moveCarets((CaretMoveContext context) -> {
        for (CaretInfo ci : context.getOriginalCarets()) {
            Position pos = target.getDocument().createPosition(Utilities.getWordEnd(target, ci.getDot()));
            context.setDot(ci, pos);
        }
    });
  </code>
  </pre>
  
  <h3><a name="navigation-filters">Navigation Filters</a></h3>
  <p>
  A boilerplate <a href="CascadingNavigationFilter.html">CascadingNavigationFilter</a> is provided to 
  make implementation of <a href="@JDK@/javax/swing/text/NavigationFilter.html">NavigationFilters</a> easier. The boilerplate
  remembers the preceding filter and will delegate to it. If you create a subclass, you may call <code>super</code> methods 
  <code>moveDot</code> and <code>setDot</code> to delegate to that previous filter and ultimately perform the action. Calling
  methods of <a href="@JDK@/javax/swing/text/NavigationFilter.FilterBypass.html">FilterBypass</a> will perform the caret action
  directly.
  </p>
  <p>
  The filter can find out the <a href="../../../api/editor/caret/package-summary.html#movement-origins">origin of the movement</a> or
  the <a href="../../../api/editor/caret/CaretInfo.html"><code>CaretInfo</code> for actual caret</a> being moved. The 
  <a href="@JDK@/javax/swing/text/NavigationFilter.FilterBypass.html">FilterBypass</a> implementation passed to 
  <a href="@JDK@/javax/swing/text/NavigationFilter.html">NavigationFilter</a> can be downcasted to <a href="NavigationFilterBypass.html">NavigationFilterBypass</a>,
  which provides this extended information.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="compatibilty">Backwards compatibility</a></h3>
  
  <h3><a name="usecases">Use cases</a></h3>
  <p>
  Use cases are shown in javadoc documentation of particular methods.
