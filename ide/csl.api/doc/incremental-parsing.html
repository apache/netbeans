        <h2>GSF Incremental Updating</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          GSF supports incremental updating. As the name implies, this means that
          there is support to do cheaper incremental updates to data, insead
          of computing everything from scratch, when something changes in the editor.
          This shows up in several places:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Parsing</b>. Your parser is told that edits are confined to
              a certain region in the document. If you know that this is inside
              a single method function, you can simply parse <i>just that function</i>
              again, do some surgery on your abstract syntax tree, and you're done.
              This makes parsing faster.
              <br/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Embedding</b>. Suppose the user is editing JavaScript in a
              <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> block in an HTML file. The virtual
              source provider for CSS knows that this doesn't affect CSS. Therefore,
              several optimizations are possible:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It doesn't have to regenerate the CSS virtual source, it can use
                  the existing one, and therefore
                </li>
                <li>
                  The CSS virtual source doesn't have to be parsed again. In fact,
                  it doesn't even have to have the parse tree offsets updated, since
                  parse tree offsets apply to the virtual source only, and the
                  position mapping is maintained by the virtual source which updated
                  the position mappings while checking the embedded scenario.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Features downstream, like semantic highlighting, can tell that
                  the parsing result for CSS was not updated, so it can more cheaply
                  update itself, just reusing the most recent highlighting result
                  from CSS and just updating the offsets.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br/><br/>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>GSF Features</b>. When features are aware of incremental support, they
              can do less work. As described above, in the embedding scenario,
              the GSF feature implementations can tell when a whole language is
              skipped because its virtual source wasn't affected. Thus, the navigator,
              semantic highglighting etc. only have to do work based on which languages
              were involved in the edits.
              <br/><br/>
              Note however that this isn't limited to the embedding scenarios.
              An incremental update aware parser can mark a parser result as
              unchanged. For example, if the user edited whitespace (outside of a string)
              or a comment, the abstract syntax tree is unaffected, and if the
              parser communicates this by marking the parser result unchanged, then
              GSF features like navigation won't have to do any work.
              <br/><br/>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Faster Implementations</b>. Usually an incremental parse won't be
              semantically identical to the previous parser result. Yes, you parsed
              a single function again, but the user probably typed something such
              that the method body is now slightly different. However, the fact
              that just the method has changed is something you can use to your advantage
              when implementing the various GSF feature callbacks. For example,
              in semantic highlighting, you only have to re-analyze the updated
              method (unless there are language specific or feature specific reasons
              you have to analyze more than just the method).
              <br/><br/>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Support</h3>
        <p>
          If you tell the infrastructure that you support incremental updating,
          GSF will keep some extra data around. First, it will keep your most recent
          parser result (and for embedded files, you more recent virtual source translation).
          Second, it will keep track of all the edits that have occurred since the
          last parser request.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it's time to parse your file again, your incremental parser will
          be handed the edit history, and your previous parser result, and you
          can create a new parser result by analyzing your previous result and the
          edit deltas.
        </p>
        <h3>Edit History</h3>
        <p>
          The most important concept for incremental updating is the
          <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/EditHistory.html">EditHistory</a> object.
          GSF provides you with an <code>EditHistory</code> object when
          you are asked to parse (for incremental parsers) or when you are
          asked to generate a virtual source (for incremental embedding models).
          The <code>EditHistory</code> object provides information about
          all the edits that have occurred since your last parse job.
          Along with the <code>EditHistory</code> object, you are passed your
          most recent result, such that you can base your incremental computations
          on it.
        </p>
        <p>
        The EditHistory tracks edits accurately, so you can use the
        <code>convertOldToNew()</code> method to translate a pre-edits offsets
        to a post-edits offsets.  However, the EditHistory maintains a
        more interesting concept: the <b>affected region</b>.  The affected
        region is roughly the start and end offsets in the original document
        and the corresponding start and end offsets in the edited document.
        You can think of the affected region as the "damaged region".
        Everything before and after the affected region was unchanged.
        The following key attributes are provided by EditHistory:
        <ol>
        <li> The start offset</li>
        <li> The original size</li>
        <li> The new size</li>
        </ol>
        These three parameters indicate that in the old document, the text between
        <code>offset</code> and <code>offset+originalSize</code> has been modified,
        and after the edits, this region corresponds to
        <code>offset</code> to <code>offset+editedSize</code>. Put another way,
        all document positions below <code>offset</code> are unaffected by the edits,
        and all document positions above <code>offset+originalSize</code> are uniformly
        shifted up by a delta of <code>editedSize-originalSize</code> (which can be negative,
        when more text was deleted than added).
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's how this works. First, let's suppose we insert some text:
          <br/>
          <img src="history1.png" />
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Here, we've inserted <code>XY</code> between the characters <code>F</code>
          and <code>G</code>.  Here, the <code>offset</code> where the differences
          begin is 6. In the old document, the differences also end at offset 6,
          whereas in the edited document, the differences end at 8.
          Therefore, our <code>offset</code> is 6, the <code>originalSize</code> is 0,
          the <code>editedSize</code> is 2, and therefore the <code>delta</code> is +2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a more complicated example, where we've performed multiple edits.
          The affected region is going to be the extent surrounding all edits
          from the edits to the lowest offset in the document, to the edits at the
          highest offset in the document:
          <br/>
          <img src="history2.png" />
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Here's we've deleted one character from two different locations in
          the document - <code>D</code> and <code>H</code>. The blue regions
          show the old region and the new corresponding region. Yes, some
          of the contents within the old region are still there in the new region,
          but the <b>key</b> point is that <b>before</b> the affected offset,
          both documents are identical, and similarly, after the end of the
          affected regions, both documents are identical. Typically, when
          a user is editing, the changes will be local to a small region
          (such as a function body), and an incremental parser can decide
          that the entire affected region is in an incrementally parseable block.
          It can also use the block delta to adjust offsets - add the delta
          to all offsets outside the old region block.
        </p>
        <h3>Incremental Parsing</h3>
        <p>
          To implement incremental parsing, rather than extending the plain
          <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/Parser.html">Parser</a>
          interface, implement the
          <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/IncrementalParser.html">IncrementalParser</a>
          interface instead.
          GSF will store the most recent parser result, and track editing history,
          for source files that are parsed by an incremental parser.
          The first time the file is opened, no previous parser result is available,
          so the plain parsing method will be called. However, for subsequent edits,
          the incremental parser will be called instead. If it fails, the regular
          parse method will be called instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your incremental parser will typically perform the following steps:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Look up the <code>EditHistory</code>'s offset.
            </li>
            <li>
              First, look in the token hierarchy and see if the edits are confined
              to whitespace or comments only, or other lexical regions that won't
              affect the parse tree. If so, just return the previous parse result,
              or a clone of it, and mark its <code>setUpdateState</code>
              with <code>ParserResult.UpdateState.NO_SEMANTIC_CHANGE</code>
              and you're done.
            </li>
            <li>
              Look in the previous parsing result's abstract syntax tree
              for the node surrounding the given offset.  For example, in JavaScript,
              we want to incrementally compile function bodies, so we look for
              the function node surrounding the offset. If there is no such
              function node, we're editing outside of functions and incremental
              parsing isn't available, so we just exit. (Normal parsing will be
              invoked by the infrastructure instead.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Look at the <code>EditHistory</code> and make sure the entire
              affected region (<code>history.getStart()</code> and <code>history.getOldEnd</code>)
              is completely inside the function body. If not, we've edited outside
              of just a single function, so just exit.
            </li>
            <li>
              We now know the function to be incrementally edited. We can also compute
              its <b>NEW</b> dimensions; it starts at the same offset as before,
              and it ends at <code>history.convertOldToNew(oldFunctionEnd)</code>.
              That's right, the end of the function is outside the edited region,
              so (as described in the EditHistory section above) we just have to take
              the old offset and shift it by <code>history.getSizeDelta()</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              With the new function offsets, we just look up the source code, via
              <code>document.getText(offset, newEnd-offset)</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              We parse the new function body. This might require to run the parser
              in a special mode. For JavaScript, I modified the parser to have a special
              method which lets me parse function bodies and return a function node.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next we need to adjust all the source offsets in the AST. The offset
              in the input we passed to the parser was 0, but this function is really
              at <code>oldFunctionStart</code>, so add <code>oldFunctionStart</code>
              to all AST node start and end offsets to shift the AST nodes to their
              correct place in the edited buffer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Similarly, adjust the error offsets of any parser errors that were
              registered during parsing of the method body.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, we need to remove the old function from the abstract syntax tree.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, we need to update the offsets for all the AST nodes. None of the
              nodes should be in the actual edited area (which was all inside the
              now recompiled function). Thus, we just have to iterate over the nodes
              and adjust the offsets; all offsets less than <code>history.getStart()</code>
              can be left alone, and all offsets greater than or equal to
              <code>history.getOldEnd()</code> should be incremented by
              <code>history.getSizeDelta()</code>. There are methods on the <code>EditHistory</code>
              object to do this.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, we insert our own function node into the AST in the exact same place
              the previous function node was sitting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, we filter through all the error messages in the previous parser
              result. Any errors that were in the old function (NOTE - in the whole old function
              range, not just in the <code>EditHistory</code> affected region since
              we recompiled the entire function, not just the affected region) should
              be removed, and all other errors passed on. Finally, add in our new
              error messages from the compiled method.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, we create a new <code>ParserResult</code> instance, initialize
              it with our AST, our updated error list, and set its <code>setUpdateState</code>
              to <code>ParserResult.UpdateState.UPDATED</code>. We also store in our
              own ParserResult, references to the old and new function nodes we replaced.
              This will be used by feature implementations like our <code>SemanticAnalyzer</code>
              to perform incremental semantic analysis by only looking at the given
              function node subtree.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        Note that the JavaScript module already performs incremental parsing, so
        you can look at its implementation for inspiration.


        <h3>Incremental Updating</h3>
        <p>
        The previous section described how to perform incremental parsing. From the
        checklist you can see that implementing incremental parsing isn't nontrivial.
        It may be even more difficult in cases where you don't own the parser yourself.
        For example, for Ruby, Python and Groovy the parser will probably be
        JRuby, Jython, and Groovyc respectively, so parsing method bodies for example
        will require support in the corresponding projects.
      </p>
      <p>
      That doesn't mean incremental updating isn't possible. Parsing itself will have
      to process the full AST, but you can still analyze the edited region and
      reduce the amount of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      As before, you should implement the
          <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/IncrementalParser.html">IncrementalParser</a>
          interface, such that GSF will pass your previous parser result and the <code>EditHistory</code>
          to you. Then, you parse the request - and unfortunately, you'll be parsing the entire
          document.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, you should now use the <code>EditHistory</code> along with the previous
      <code>ParserResult</code> to see whether the changes were local to a single block
      such as a method. If they were, you can also compute exactly which method was just
      updated, by looking up the corresponding offset in the <code>EditHistory</code>
      and looking in your new parser result.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now you know that only a single method in your new parser result is actually "new".
    In your downstream feature implementations, such as the semantic analyzer,
    you can use this information to combine your previous result (which you stashed
    on your previous parser result), with local computations based only on the changed
    method.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, you can drive the often more expensive computations (type analysis,
          semantic analysis, navigator/outline computations, etc) to do simple, incremental
          updates, even if the parse tree itself was fully regenerated by a non-incremental
          parser!
        </p>

        <h3>Incremental Embedding Models</h3>
        <p>
          GSF supports embedding through "embedding models", which produce a "virtual source",
          one for each targeted parser language in an embedded language. For example,
          in an RHTML file, there is a virtual source generated for JavaScript (which gives
          a JavaScript view of the file, typically concatenating the various
          <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> blocks and a few other things), as well as one for
          CSS, and one for Ruby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each virtual source translator takes the original source language and computes
          a virtual source.  With the incremental update support, a virtual source
          translator can tell the infrastructure that it supports incremental updates.
          First, instead of implementing the
          <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/EmbeddingModel.html">EmbeddingModel</a>
          interface as before, implement
          <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/InrementalEmbeddingModel.html">IncrementalEmbeddingModel</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you do that, GSF will cache your virtual source for you, and when it's time
          to update the virtual source parse trees, it will call your incremental
          embedding model and pass it your previous virtual source and an
          <code>EditHistory</code> object. You can use the <code>EditHistory</code> to
          determine if the edits affects your virtual source.
          For example, for <code>JavaScript</code>, if you've edited something inside
          the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element (CSS code), the edit can't possibly affect
          the JavaScript virtual source. Therefore, the virtual source doesn't change,
          and therefore the previous JavaScript parse tree for the virtual source doesn't
          have to be reparsed - it doesn't even have to be updated for new AST offsets,
          since the AST itself hasn't changed. However, the embedding model itself
          is responsible for mapping AST offsets to source document offsets.
          Therefore, the incremental embedding model needs to go through its
          position mapping tables and update them. Again, this typically just means
          shifting positions above the affected region up by the edit history's
          size delta.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this succeeds, your embedding model can just return
          <code>IncrementalEmbeddingModel.UpdateState.COMPLETED</code>. This tells the
          infrastructure that the embedding model was updated, and there is nothing else
          to do - it doesn't have to parse the result of the virtual source!
        </p>
        <p>
            But what if the user edited something in an edit region that affects the
            virtual source? In that case, it can simply return
          <code>IncrementalEmbeddingModel.UpdateState.FAILED</code>. This tells the
          infrastructure that an incremental update cannot be completed, and GSF
          will perform a new (non-incremental) virtual source translation, and
          parse the result.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, if you're somewhere in between - you updated the virtual source
          such that it now reflects the recent edits, but the model changed such that
          it must be reparsed, return
          <code>IncrementalEmbeddingModel.UpdateState.UPDATED</code>. This tells the
          infrastructure that the virtual source is up to date and that a parse
          result should be computed for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a complete example of how this works for an embedding model; this is the CSS embedding
          model's incremental update:
          <pre>
    IncrementalEmbeddingModel.UpdateState incrementalUpdate(EditHistory history) {
        // Clear cache
        // prevLexOffset = prevAstOffset = 0;
        prevLexOffset = history.convertOldToNew(prevLexOffset);

        int offset = history.getStart();
        int limit = history.getOldEnd();
        int delta = history.getSizeDelta();

        boolean codeOverlaps = false;
        for (CodeBlockData codeBlock : codeBlocks) {
            // Block not affected by move
            if (codeBlock.sourceEnd <= offset) {
                continue;
            }
            if (codeBlock.sourceStart >= limit) {
                codeBlock.sourceStart += delta;
                codeBlock.sourceEnd += delta;
                continue;
            }
            if (codeBlock.sourceStart <= offset && codeBlock.sourceEnd >= limit) {
                codeBlock.sourceEnd += delta;
                codeOverlaps = true;
                continue;
            }
            return IncrementalEmbeddingModel.UpdateState.FAILED;
        }

        return codeOverlaps ? IncrementalEmbeddingModel.UpdateState.UPDATED : IncrementalEmbeddingModel.UpdateState.COMPLETED;
    }
          </pre>
        </p>


        <h3>Incremental Feature Updates</h3>
        <p>
          <code>ParserResult</code> stores an <code>UpdateState</code> enum value
          indicating what kind of update was performed. For example, if it is
          <code>NO_SEMANTIC_CHANGE</code> we know that in this parser result,
          nothing in the AST changed (though offsets may have changed).
          This lets the infrastructure know that it can take certain shortcuts.
          For example, semantic highlighting won't recompute the data, it will just
          update its own offsets based on the edit history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not all GSF feature implementations are using the incremental data yet;
          this will change as soon as possible...
        </p>
        <p>
          You should use the same approach for feature implementations in your language
          plugin. Start with the most expensive computations (for example, type
          analysis), and use the "what changed" data (either the <code>EditHistory</code>,
          or specific parse tree nodes derived from the <code>EditHistory</code>)
          to just filter your previously computed result.
        </p>
