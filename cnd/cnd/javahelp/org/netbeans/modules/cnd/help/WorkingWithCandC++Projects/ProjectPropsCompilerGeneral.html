       C/C++ Project Properties Dialog Box: Compiler
    </h2>
    <p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp;</small>
    </p>
    <p>
       The C or C++ Compiler panel lets you set compiler options for your C or C++ Application
      project, Library project, or file. The options shown in the panel are dependent on the tool
      collection that is in effect. Changes you make apply only to the project configuration that
      is selected at the top of the dialog box.
    </p>
    <p>
       Selections in this dialog determine the compiler command options that will be used when the
      project is compiled. You can see the command line options that are in effect when you make
      selections in this dialog box by clicking the button next to the Additional Options field.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Include Directories.</b> Type the absolute or relative path to the directories containing
      headers for your project, or click the button to browse to the directories and add them. On
      the file browser dialog box, you can specify Absolute or Relative path.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Include Headers.</b> Type the filename of the header file to include or click the button
       to browse to the file and add it. This option causes
       the compiler to treat the filename as if it appears in your source files as an #include
       directive.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Preprocessor Definitions.</b> Add definitions for macros used by the project. Click the
      text field or the button to open the Preprocessor Definitions dialog box to add definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Use Linker Libraries.</b> Use libraries defined in the Linker Configuration. If the
      check box is selected, include paths and user-defined macros for each library are added using
      the <tt>pkg-config</tt> command.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Development Mode.</b> Select a mode to determine the set of compiler optimizations that
      will be used when the project is compiled.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Warning Level.</b> Select the level of detail for warnings issued by the compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Architecture.</b> Select 32-bit or 64-bit architecture for the binary.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Strip Symbols.</b> Select the checkbox to remove symbol tables from the binary.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>C Standard.</b> Specifies whether project sources should be parsed as&nbsp;C89,
       C99, or C11 code. When set to Default, use the compiler's default C standard. This setting is inherited from the project level to the folder level and file
      level, and can be overridden by changing the C&nbsp;Standard setting in the properties of a
      folder or file.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>C++ Standard.</b> Specifies whether project sources should be parsed as&nbsp;C++98 code
      or C++11 code. When set to Default, use the compiler's default C++ standard.
      This setting is inherited from the project level to the folder level and file
      level, and can be overridden by changing the C++&nbsp;Standard setting in the properties of a
      folder or file.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Multithreading Level.</b> Select the type of multithreading, if any, used by the project.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Library Level.</b> Select an option to specify which standard libraries are included.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Standards Evolution.</b> If your project is written to older C/C++ standards, or relies
      on newer non-ISO-compliant options, you might need to select a standards option.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Language Extensions.</b> If your project strictly conforms to ISO C standards without
      K&amp;R C compatibility extensions, you should select None.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Tool.</b> The command to run the compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Additional Options.</b> Type any other compiler command line options in the text field,
      or click the button to open a dialog box to see the options that are currently in effect. In
      the dialog box, you can type more flags in the additional option in the Additional Options
      panel.
