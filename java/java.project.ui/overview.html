Support for creating projects involving Java sources.

<p>
Besides the visible Javadoc, this module permits a project to add implementations
of {@link org.netbeans.spi.java.classpath.ClassPathProvider}
and/or {@link org.netbeans.spi.java.queries.SourceForBinaryQueryImplementation}
and/or {@link org.netbeans.spi.java.queries.SourceLevelQueryImplementation}
and/or {@link org.netbeans.spi.java.queries.JavadocForBinaryQueryImplementation}
and/or {@link org.netbeans.spi.java.queries.AccessibilityQueryImplementation}
and/or {@link org.netbeans.spi.java.queries.MultipleRootsUnitTestForSourceQueryImplementation}
and/or {@link org.netbeans.spi.java.queries.BinaryForSourceQueryImplementation}
into the project lookup (rather than global lookup).
The implementations will be consulted only in the case the relevant file
belongs to that project (according to {@link org.netbeans.api.project.FileOwnerQuery}).
This helps avoid the need to consult irrelevant query implementations.
