-->


<!--
This is the root element.
-->
<!ELEMENT constraints (check-info*)>


<!--
This represents an information, about a particular Constraint.
Provides information of a Constraint represented by corresponding
<check> element in validation.xml.
Sub element <name> is used to link this element with the
corresponding <check> element in validation.xml.
-->
<!ELEMENT check-info (name, classname, arguments?)>


<!--
This element represents information of a Constraint class arguments.
Number of sub elements, <argument> should match with the number
of <parameter> sub elements, of corresponding <arguments> element
in validation.xml
-->
<!ELEMENT arguments (argument+)>


<!--
This element represents information of a single Constraint class
argument.
Sub elements <name> should match with the <name> sub element of
corresponding <parameter> element in constraints.xml
-->
<!ELEMENT argument (name, type?)>


<!--
Used in two elements <check-info> and <argument>
In <check-info>, it represents a Constraint name and is the linking
element between <check> element in validation.xml and <check-info>
element in constraints.xml.
In <argument>, it represents argument name and is the linking element
between <parameter> element in validation.xml and <argument> element
in constraints.xml.
-->
<!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)>


<!--
This element represents Constraint class name.
Constraint class should provide the constructor with no arguments.
Constraint class should also provide the set* methods for all the
required arguments.
Constraint class is always created using default constructor and
then the arguments are set using set* methods.
-->
<!ELEMENT classname (#PCDATA)>


<!--
This element represents the type of an argument.
If not specified, it defaults to java.lang.String
