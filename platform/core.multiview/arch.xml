    There is an introduction to MultiView and its usage in its 
    <a href="@TOP@/overview-summary.html">javadoc</a>. It covers the major part 
    of available usecases.
    Here is just
    a list of frequently asked or interesting questions slowly expanding as
    people ask them:
    <h3>MultiView faq:</h3>
    
    <usecase id="serialization" name="How does serialization work?" >
<em><b>Q:</b>
How does serialization of multiviews work and what needs to be serializable?
</em>
<p>
First of all, you don't need to worry about serialization if all your <code>MultiViewDescription</code> instances
contained in the multiview state to be non serializable.
Meaning they all return <code>TopComponent.PERSISTENCE_NEVER</code> in <code>MultiViewDescription.getPersistenceType()</code>.
</p>
<p>
If at least one of the views requires serialization, you have no choice but to make all
<code>MultiViewDescription</code> implementors serializable. 
You also can persist the MultiViewElement instances that the multiview contains. The algorithm here is a bit complicated for
performance reasons. Only those Elements are stored that were created during the session and which are Serializable.
So if the user never switches to the 4rd tab, and it's corresponding element and visual component never get created, then
it won't be stored. (We would have to create it just for the sake of persistance).
So if your visual component needs some inital context for creation, you should store it in the description instance, and if the visual component
wants to store it's state (location of cursor, selected field, something else that makes sense for the opened component) you should store it in the MultiViewElement.
So basically if you are always able create the Element from Description without any persisted data, you don't need to persist anything.
</p>
<p>
If you define your own <code>CloseOperationHandler</code> implementation for the multiview component, then you also ought to define it
Serializable. Otherwise it will be silently replaced by the default handler on restoration of the multiview component.
</p>
</usecase>

    <usecase id="displayName" name="How to set the display name?" >
<em><b>Q:</b>
 How do I set the display name for the multiview component?
</em>
<p>
Each <code>MultiViewDescription</code> defines display name and icon. While the icon 
is meant for the whole document/view tab, the display name is just for the inner switching button.
So how does one set the name for the whole MultiView component? It can be done when creating the component.
</p>
<pre>
    TopComponent mvtc = MultiViewFactory.createMultiView(myDescriptions);
    mvtc.setDisplayName("My static mvtc displayName");
</pre>
<p>
Later in the lifecycle of the component, it can be also influenced from within the individual
multiview visual elements using the <code>MultiViewElementCallback.updateTitle()</code> method.
</p>
</usecase>

<answer id="arch-what">
Multi views are general mechanism for displaying several perspectives, or views of data,
which will be used consistently across whole IDE window system. Using multi views
will enable modules to visually represent data document or object in unified manner
at one specific place in the system, yet still allowing for different perspectives
of data viewing.

            Is your module correctly internationalized?

            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.

            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to

            making it too easy for other people to misuse your implementation
            details, that is why you should have good reason for not

Yes, there are practical limits enforced in visual design. Number of different

<answer id="perf-scale">
Perfomance of MultiViewTopComponent is influenced by performance of components
that will act as individual MultiViewElements. From what we know today that means
performance of Editor, Form Editor, Component Palette, Property Sheet, VCS Outputs,
To Do list. Also number of view elements affect performance of MultiViewTopComponent.
<br/>
The separation of MultiViewElement and MultiViewDescription interfaces is meant to allow lazy creation of not 
visible components and providing them on demand. This should influence first usage performance.
