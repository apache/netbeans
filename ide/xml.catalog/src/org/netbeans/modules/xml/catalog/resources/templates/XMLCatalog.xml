         to specify the resource, e.g: -->

    <!-- If xsi:schemaLocation is specified in XML document e.g.
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://org.company/xml/schemas http://org.company/xml/schemas/schema.xsd"
         the <system> element can be used to specify the local resource, e.g: -->
    <!--
    <system systemId="http://org.company/xml/schemas/schema.xsd" uri="file:/path/schema.xsd"/>
