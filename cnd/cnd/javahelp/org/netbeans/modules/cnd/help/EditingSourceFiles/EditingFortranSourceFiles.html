<h2>Editing Fortran Source Files</h2>
<p>
The IDE's built-in Source Editor enables you to view, create, and
edit your Fortran source code. You can open the Source Editor window by
double-clicking an editable element in the Projects window or by
choosing File > New to create a new file.
</p>
<p>
The IDE support of Fortran is more limited than the support of C and C++.
The following features are supported for Fortran:
<ul>
    <li><a href="UsingNavigator.html">Navigator window</a></li>
    <li><a href="UsingClassView.html">Classes window</a> (except for structures)</li>
    <li><a href="UsingAbbreviations.html">Code templates</a></li>
    <li><a href="../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/ConfiguringCodeStyle.html">Code formatting</a> (
        you can change the tabs and spacing, not the color-coded styles)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most other features are not yet implemented for Fortran, including code completion, code folding,
    semantic highlighting, hyperlinks between objects, and find usages.</p>
