<h2><a name="lookup">Lookup</a></h2>

<div class="nonnormative">

The whole NetBeans platform is moving toward 
installation of services via XML layer or (via the <code>@ServiceProvider</code> annotation on classes) <code>META-INF/services</code>.
Layer-based installation is more flexible in many ways. 

<p>The need for having a standard interface to access such
registrations 
gave rise to the <em>lookup</em> system first
introduced in NetBeans 3.2 and expanded upon for NetBeans 3.3. The
center of this API from the client perspective is very simple - you
can look up a class, and get an instance of that class (or a
collection of them). The service provider side of it is more complex
but useful lookup implementations are already provided in the 
core system; for common cases you can register an object into lookup just by
adding one simple file to an XML layer or <code>META-INF/services/classname</code>
in your module JAR file.

<p>This section of the Services API will first discuss what
<em>instances</em> are and how to create them from files, as this is
the core concept for service providers. It will discuss how you can
manually retrieve sets of instances as a client, which is not used
very frequently in new code but helps to understand what lookup is
doing behind the scenes. Then lookup itself is discussed, and how the
standard instance lookup works and how it relates to JDK's 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html#Service_Provider">
standard for service provider registration</a>. 
Lookup templates, which separate the
provision of instances from the provision of categories, will be
explained. 

</div>

<h3><a name="instances">Working with Instances</a></h3>

Central to the management of services and many other aspects of
NetBeans' configuration is the notion of
<em>instances</em>. An instance is just any Java object, generally
of a particular type appropriate to its use, which is provided from
some object (generally, a data object) using

<code>InstanceCookie</code>.

As an example, menu items may be added by inserting data objects
that provide this cookie into the proper folder, and having the
instance be a system action (or other things). Or an XML DTD may be
registered by placing an object with an instance of
<code>org.xml.sax.EntityResolver</code> in the proper folder.

<p>Where do these instances come from? Technically, it is up to you
to decide how to provide <code>InstanceCookie</code>; you could if
really necessary create your own data loader that provides it
according to some unusual scheme, and add files recognized by that
loader to the right folder. Practically, the APIs provide
implementations of this cookie sufficient for normal purposes.

<p>The most common way to provide an instance is using

<code>InstanceDataObject</code>.

This is a type of data object whose sole purpose is to provide the
instance cookie. It typically does so based on a class name you
supply. There are several styles of instance file; all are empty (i.e.
the file contents are of zero length, and just the file name and
attributes matter). There are then other ways of providing instances
which rely on the file contents. Here are the methods of providing
instances defined in the APIs:

<dl>

<dt><em>Default instance - <code>InstanceDataObject</code></em>

<dd><p>If there is a file with the extension <samp>*.instance</samp>, then its
name (minus extension) will be converted to a class name by replacing dashes
with dots; and a fresh instance of that class will be created and used as the
instance. For example, <samp>com-mycom-mymodule-MyAction.instance</samp>
produces an instance of the class <code>com.mycom.mymodule.MyAction</code>.</p>

<p>Since reflection is used to create the new instance, just as in the
realm of JavaBeans, the class must be loadable from your module or
otherwise from within NetBeans (technically, via the classloader found
by querying Lookup for <code>ClassLoader</code>);
public; and have a public no-argument constructor.
(Or be a

<a href="../SharedClassObject.html"><code>SharedClassObject</code></a>.)

This form is often
used for <em>singleton</em> classes such as system actions: there is
no need to specify any parameters to the constructor, any instance
will suffice.</p>


<dt><em>Default instance with separate class - <code>InstanceDataObject</code></em>

<dd><p>Rather than shoving the class name into
the file name, you can name the file more normally and specify the
class with a file attribute. Then the class name is specified as
a string-valued attribute on the instance named
<code>instanceClass</code>. For example, a keyboard shortcut
could be registered as follows in an XML layer:</p>

<pre>
&lt;<span class="function-name">file</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="constant">"C-F6.instance"</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="constant">"instanceClass"</span> <span class="variable-name">stringvalue</span>=<span class="constant">"com.mycom.mymodule.MyAction"</span>/&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">file</span>&gt;
</pre>

<p>In addition to <code>instanceClass</code> you may specify an
additional attribute <code>instanceOf</code> giving the name of a
superclass (or implemented interface) of the instance class. In fact
it may be a comma-separated list of superclasses and interfaces. While
its purpose is explained more fully

<a href="#instance-folders">below</a>,

essentially it lets you give the system a hint as to what this
instance is for before your instance class is even loaded into the VM.
For example:</p>

<pre>
&lt;<span class="function-name">file</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="constant">"com-me-some-service.instance"</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="constant">"instanceClass"</span> <span class="variable-name">stringvalue</span>=<span class="constant">"com.me.FactoryForEverything"</span>/&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="constant">"instanceOf"</span>
     <span class="variable-name">stringvalue</span>=<span class="constant">"org.xml.sax.EntityResolver,org.openide.cookies.ExecCookie"</span>/&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">file</span>&gt;
</pre>

<dt><a name="ido-methodvalue"></a><em>Non-default instance - <code>InstanceDataObject</code></em>

<dd><p>A powerful way of providing instances is to use the expressiveness
of the XML layer syntax to handle the instance creation. In this case
the file attribute <code>instanceCreate</code> can be defined and the
attribute value becomes the instance. Typically the attribute value
would be specified using the <code>methodvalue</code> syntax of
layers. For example:</p>

<pre>
&lt;<span class="function-name">file</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="constant">"com-me-some-service.instance"</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="constant">"instanceClass"</span> <span class="variable-name">stringvalue</span>=<span class="constant">"com.me.FactoryForEverything"</span>/&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="constant">"instanceCreate"</span> <span class="variable-name">methodvalue</span>=<span class="constant">"com.me.FactoryForEverything.configure"</span>/&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="constant">"myParam"</span> <span class="variable-name">urlvalue</span>=<span class="constant">"nbres:/com/me/config-1.properties"</span>/&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="constant">"instanceOf"</span>
     <span class="variable-name">stringvalue</span>=<span class="constant">"org.xml.sax.EntityResolver,org.openide.cookies.ExecCookie"</span>/&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">file</span>&gt;
</pre>

<p>According to the general system for

<code>XMLFileSystem</code>,

you now need a method <code>configure</code> in
<code>FactoryForEverything</code> which must be static; the method
need not be public (if you do not want other Java code to see it). It
may take a file object as argument if you wish - this will be the
instance file; typically you use this to pass extra configuration from
the layer, useful if you want to create multiple instances with the
same creation method. The argument may also be a map. So for example you might implement such a method
like this:</p>

<pre>
<span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="type">FactoryForEverything</span> <span class="keyword">extends</span> <span class="type">SomeBaseFactory</span>
        <span class="keyword">implements</span> <span class="type">EntityResolver</span>, <span class="type">ExecCookie</span> {
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">FactoryForEverything</span>(<span class="type">Map</span> <span class="variable-name">props</span>) {
        <span class="comment">// ...
</span>    }
    <span class="comment">// ...
</span>    <span class="comment">// Called directly from XML layer. Pass URL to
</span>    <span class="comment">// properties file from attr 'myParam'.
</span>    <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="type">Object</span> <span class="function-name">configure</span>(<span class="type">Map&lt;String,?&gt;</span> <span class="variable-name">inst</span>) <span class="keyword">throws</span> <span class="type">IOException</span> {
        <span class="type">URL</span> <span class="variable-name">u</span> = (<span class="type">URL</span>)inst.get(<span class="string">"myParam"</span>);
        <span class="type">Properties</span> <span class="variable-name">p</span> = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type">Properties</span>();
        p.load(u.openStream());
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type">FactoryForEverything</span>(p);
    }
}
</pre>

<dt><em>Serialized beans</em>

<dd><p>A simple way to provide an instance is to serialize it as a
JavaBean, into a file with the extension <samp>*.ser</samp>. This is
not very useful from a layer, because you should avoid putting
binary data into a layer, but may be useful in some circumstances.</p>

<dt><a name="xml-instances"><em>XML-based instances</em></a></dt>

<dd><p><a href="@org-openide-util@/org/openide/xml/EntityCatalog.html"><code>EntityCatalog</code></a></p></dd>
</dl>


<div class="nonnormative">

<p>Again, modules may also have additional ways of providing instances
from files. For example, currently the <code>utilities</code> module
enables any URL file (<samp>*.url</samp>) to be used directly in a
menu, as the URL file provides an instance of
<code>Presenter.Menu</code>.</p>

<p>As an interactive demonstration of these things, first go into
<b>Filesystem&nbsp;Settings</b> and make the system filesystem (first in
the list) visible; then explore its contents in <b>Filesystems</b>,
going into some subdirectory of <samp>Menu</samp>. Note the various
actions and menu separators; these are all by default instance data
objects.
You may find some of these on disk in your installation directory
under <samp>system/</samp> if you have customized them, but by default
they live in memory only.
You may copy-and-paste these instances from one place to another;
create new ones on disk and watch them be recognized and inserted
into the menus after a few seconds; and you may also choose
Customize Bean (which really customizes the provided instance) on
(say) a toolbar separator (under <code>Toolbars</code>) to change
the separator size, and serialize the result to a new
<code>*.ser</code> file which should then create a toolbar
separator.

</div>

<h3><a name="instance-folders">Folders of Instances</a></h3>


<h4><a name="instancecookie-of"><code>InstanceCookie.Of</code> and lazy class loading</a></h4>

Now it is time to mention the purpose of
<code>InstanceCookie.Of</code>. Suppose that there are two generic
interfaces under consideration: e.g. <code>javax.swing.Action</code>
and <code>org.xml.sax.EntityResolver</code>. For each interface, there
is code to find registered instances, all under the
<samp>Services/</samp> folder. Furthermore, using either of these
interfaces is relatively rare, and might not happen at all during a
NetBeans session; and the implementations of the instances are complicated
and involve a lot of code, so it is undesirable (for performance
reasons) to load these implementations unless and until they are
really needed. If you write the layers simply like this:

<pre>
&lt;<span class="function-name">filesystem</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Services"</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Hidden"</span>&gt;
            &lt;<span class="function-name">file</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"com-me-MyAction.instance"</span>/&gt;
            &lt;<span class="function-name">file</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"com-me-MyResolver.instance"</span>/&gt;
        &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
    &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">filesystem</span>&gt;
</pre>

everything will work, <em>but</em> this is inefficient. Consider some
piece of code asking for all actions. The search through the services
folder for actions would ask each of these files if it provides an
instance cookie assignable to <code>javax.swing.Action</code>. For
<samp>com-me-MyAction.instance</samp>, this will load the class
<code>com.me.MyAction</code>, determine that it implements
<code>Action</code>, and thus create a <code>MyAction</code> instance
and return it; so far so good. But when
<samp>com-me-MyResolver.instance</samp> is encountered, it will again
load <code>com.me.MyResolver</code>, only to find that this does not
implement <code>Action</code> and skip the instance. The behavior is
correct, but now the <code>MyResolver</code> class has been loaded
into the VM even though no one will ever use it (unless a resolver
search is made). This will degrade startup time and memory usage (and
thus performance).

<p>So the better solution is to mark each file in advance, saying what
interfaces it is intended to provide in its instance:

<pre>
&lt;<span class="function-name">filesystem</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Services"</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Hidden"</span>&gt;
            &lt;<span class="function-name">file</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"com-me-MyAction.instance"</span>&gt;
                &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"instanceOf"</span> <span class="variable-name">stringvalue</span>=<span class="string">"javax.swing.Action"</span>/&gt;
            &lt;/<span class="function-name">file</span>&gt;
            &lt;<span class="function-name">file</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"com-me-MyResolver.instance"</span>&gt;
                &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"instanceOf"</span> <span class="variable-name">stringvalue</span>=<span class="string">"org.xml.sax.EntityResolver"</span>/&gt;
            &lt;/<span class="function-name">file</span>&gt;
        &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
    &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">filesystem</span>&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Now the folder instance processor for <code>Action</code> will pass
over <samp>com-me-MyResolver.instance</samp> without needing to load
<code>com.me.MyResolver</code>, since it sees that its interfaces are
declared, and <code>Action</code> is not among them. Of course, the
interface classes - <code>Action</code> and
<code>EntityResolver</code> - need to be loaded right away, but they
were probably already loaded anyway, so this is acceptable.
</p>

<p><strong>Caution:</strong> if you do supply an
<code>instanceOf</code> attribute, but it does <em>not</em> list all
of the implemented interfaces and superclasses of the actual
implementation class (including that implementation class itself,
which is not implied), a lookup query on one of the missing
superclasses <em>may or may not</em> succeed. So you should include in
<code>instanceOf</code> any superclasses and interfaces that you think
someone might use in a lookup query, possibly including the actual
implementation class.</p>

<h3><a name="service-lookup">Lookup and Service Installation</a></h3>

The client side of the lookup system centers around one class,

<a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/Lookup.html"><code>Lookup</code></a>.

In the simplest usage, all that is needed is to get some single
instance of a given class (or subclass). For example, if some kind of
service has been defined as an interface or abstract class, and you
wish to find the implementation of it, you
may simply use:

<pre>
<span class="type">MyService</span> <span class="variable-name">impl</span> = (<span class="type">MyService</span>)Lookup.getDefault().<a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/Lookup.html#lookup-java.lang.Class-">lookup</a>(MyService.<span class="keyword">class</span>);
<span class="keyword">if</span> (impl == <span class="constant">null</span>) <span class="comment">/* nothing registered */</span> ...
impl.useIt();
</pre>

Such implementation has to be registered by some module to the system. 
Either via layer as described above or as a JDK's
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html#Service_Provider">
service provider</a>. If some module wants to register for example 
<span class="type">org.me.MyService</span> it shall provide file name
<span class="function-name">META-INF/services/org.me.MyService</span> in its own JAR
with single line containing name of the implementation class (for example
<span class="type">org.you.MyServiceImpl</span>).
This is normally done more easily by using the <code>@ServiceProvider</code> annotation in <code>MyService.java</code>.
The lookup infrastructure
will then load the implementation class and call its default constructor 
to answer the query in the above example.
<P>

<div class="nonnormative">
    The Lookup supports two small extensions to the 
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html#Service_Provider">JDK's
    standard</a>. It allows a module to remove class registered by
    another one. That is why it is possible to write a module that
    disables the <span class="type">org.you.MyServiceImpl</span> implementation
    and provides its own. This the expected content of its 
    <span class="function-name">META-INF/services/org.me.MyService</span> file:
    <PRE>
  # remove the other implementation (by prefixing the line with <em>#-</EM>)
  #-<span class="type">org.you.MyServiceImpl</span>

  # provide my own
  org.alien.MyServiceAlienImpl
    </PRE>
    The reason why the removal line starts with <em>#-</em> is to keep
    compatibility with JDK's implementation. The <em>#</em> means comment
    and thus JDK will not interpret the line and will not get confused by
    the <em>-</em> before class name.
    
    <p>Second extension allows ordering of items. The class implementing
    the interface can be followed by advisory position attribute. If
    multiple implementations are defined in one file then each can be
    followed by its own positioning attribute. When querying
    on an interface, items with a smaller position are guaranteed 
    to be returned before items with a larger position. Items with no defined 
    position are returned last. Example of content of 
    <span class="function-name">META-INF/services/org.me.MyService</span>
    file could be:
    <pre>
  <span class="type">org.you.MyServiceImpl</span>
  #position=20
  <span class="type">org.you.MyMoreImportantServiceImpl</span>
  #position=10
    </pre>
    The <span class="function-name">MyMoreImportantServiceImpl</span>
    will be returned in lookup before the 
    <span class="function-name">MyServiceImpl</span>.
    It is recommended to pick up larger numbers so that there is
    gap for other modules if they need to get in front of your item. And, 
    again, to keep compatibility the position attribute must starts with
    comment delimiter.
<p>Both extensions are supported by <code>@ServiceProvider</code>.</p>
</DIV>

<P>
If more than one implementation has been registered, the "first" will
be returned. For example, if the implementations were present in the
<samp>Services</samp> folder as <samp>*.instance</samp> files, then
folder order would control this.

<p>As mentioned above, the NetBeans default lookup searches in the
<samp>Services</samp> folder and its subfolders for instances whose
class matches the requested class. Technically, it looks for data
objects with <code>InstanceCookie.Of</code> claiming to match the
requested superclass, or plain <code>InstanceCookie</code> whose
<code>instanceClass</code> is assignable to it.

<p>Note that you may use this method to find singleton instances of
subclasses of

<a href="../SharedClassObject.html"><code>SharedClassObject</code></a>

that have been registered in lookup (as is normally the case for

system options).

However for this purpose it is simpler to use the static finder method

<a href="../SharedClassObject.html#findObject-java.lang.Class-boolean-"><code>SharedClassObject.findObject(Class,&nbsp;true)</code></a>

which is guaranteed to find the singleton whether it was registered in
lookup or not (if necessary it will first

<a href="#settings">initialize</a>

the object according to saved state).

<p>In many situations it is normal for there to be more than one
registered implementation of a service. In such a case you use a more
general method:

<pre>
<span class="type"><a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/Lookup.Template.html">Lookup.Template</a></span> <span class="variable-name">templ</span> = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type">Lookup.Template</span>(MyService.<span class="keyword">class</span>);
<span class="keyword">final</span> <span class="type"><a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/Lookup.Result.html">Lookup.Result</a></span> <span class="variable-name">result</span> = Lookup.getDefault().lookup(templ);
<span class="type">Collection</span> <span class="variable-name">impls</span> = result.allInstances(); <span class="comment">// Collection&lt;MyService&gt;

// Pay attention to subsequent changes in the result.
</span>result.addLookupListener(<span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type"><a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/LookupListener.html">LookupListener</a></span>() {
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">resultChanged</span>(<span class="type">LookupEvent</span> <span class="variable-name">ev</span>) {

});
</pre>

Here you receive a collection of all instances matching your query,
again in the order found if this matters. You can also listen to
changes in the list (additions, deletions, and reorderings). It is
fine to keep a <code>Lookup.Result</code> for a long period of time as
it may implement its own caching scheme and only really compute the
instances when <code>allInstances</code> is called; in fact it may be
more efficient to keep a result, and listen for changes in it, than to
repeatedly call <code>lookup</code> and create fresh result objects.

<p>When a lookup query is finished - for example when
<code>Lookup.Result.allInstances()</code> returns some
<code>Collection</code> of instances - it is guaranteed that all
objects registered in the same thread prior to the call to
<code>lookup()</code> or prior to some change notification on the
<code>Lookup.Result</code>, will be returned. Specifically, lookup
instances registered via module layer will be available by the time
<code>ModuleInstall.restored()</code> (or <code>.installed()</code>)
is called. There are two situations in which lookup results may be
incomplete: when you are currently inside the dynamic scope of some
method providing a lookup instance itself; and when you are
dynamically inside a <code>DataLoader</code> method involved in
recognizing data objects.

<h3><a name="lookup-ids">Persisting Lookup Information</a></h3>

In some circumstances it is necessary to not only find registered
objects, but to select some of them and make this selection
persistent. For example, some setting may have as its value a choice
among available services matching some interface; the value needs to
be persisted, but it is the identity of the choice, rather than the
full state of the instance itself, which must be stored.

<p>In such cases it is possible to use code like this:

<pre>
<span class="type">Lookup.Template</span> <span class="variable-name">templ</span> = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type">Lookup.Template</span>(MyService.<span class="keyword">class</span>);
<span class="type">Lookup.Result</span> <span class="variable-name">result</span> = Lookup.getDefault().lookup(templ);
<span class="type">Iterator</span> <span class="variable-name">it</span> = result.allItems().iterator();
<span class="keyword">while</span> (it.hasNext()) {
    <span class="type"><a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/Lookup.Item.html">Lookup.Item</a></span> <span class="variable-name">item</span> = (<span class="type">Lookup.Item</span>)it.next();
    <span class="type">String</span> <span class="variable-name">displayName</span> = item.getDisplayName();
    <span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="comment">/* user accepts displayName as the right one */</span>) {
        <span class="type">MyService</span> <span class="variable-name">instance</span> = (<span class="type">MyService</span>)item.getInstance();
        <span class="comment">// use instance for now, and ...
</span>        <span class="type">String</span> <span class="variable-name">id</span> = item.getId();
        someSettings.setChosenService(id);
        <span class="keyword">break</span>;
    }
}
<span class="comment">// later...
</span><span class="type">String</span> <span class="variable-name">storedID</span> = someSettings.getChosenService();
<span class="type">Lookup.Template</span> <span class="variable-name">templ</span> = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type"><a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/Lookup.Template.html#Template-java.lang.Class-java.lang.String-java.lang.Object-">Lookup.Template</a></span>(MyService.<span class="keyword">class</span>, storedID, <span class="constant">null</span>);
<span class="type">Iterator</span> <span class="variable-name">it</span> = Lookup.getDefault().lookup(templ).allInstances().iterator();
<span class="keyword">if</span> (! it.hasNext()) <span class="comment">/* failed to find it... */</span>
<span class="type">MyService</span> <span class="variable-name">instance</span> = (<span class="type">MyService</span>)it.next();
<span class="comment">// use instance again
</span></pre>

The ID permits you to track which instance from all those available in
the lookup result was last selected by the user, and find the "same"
instance later, perhaps after a restart of NetBeans. The exact form of
the ID is the private knowledge of the implementor of the lookup, but
typically if the instance has been provided via layer the ID will
mention the name of the file from which it was derived.

<h3><a name="lookup-impl">Creating Lookups</a></h3>

There are a number of reasons to create your own lookup
implementation. For one thing, the lookup system which scans the
<samp>Services/</samp> folder will recognize instances of subclasses
of <code>Lookup</code> specially by <em>proxying</em> to them. This
can be very powerful because you may register just one layer file
which points to your custom lookup, which in turn may provide an
unlimited number of actual instances/items for queries (and compute
them in a manner other than registration by files). Another reason is
to associate a context with a data object using

<code>Environment.Provider</code>;

for example the data object might be an XML file and this provider
might be registered with the file by means of the public ID of the
doctype (informally, the DTD). Here the provider has an associated
lookup which can serve requests for cookies and such things.
See more information about <a href="#xml-instances">associating lookups
with XML files</a>.

<p>The simplest way to create a fresh lookup is to base it on other
existing ones.

<a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/lookup/ProxyLookup.html"><code>ProxyLookup</code></a>

accepts a list of other lookup implementations (in the constructor and
also changeable later). The results it provides are constructed by
merging together the results of the delegate lookups.

<p>
<a name="folderlookup"></a>

If you want to use the common mechanism of finding instances in
folders (or subfolders) and serving these as the results,

<a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/lookup/Lookups.html#forPath-java.lang.String-">Lookups.forPath(String)</a>

makes this possible: you need only provide a name of a folder to look in, and
use

<code>Lookups.forPath(theFolderName)</code>

to retrieve a lookup implementation which will scan this folder and
its subfolders for data objects with <code>InstanceCookie</code>
matching the lookup template. Furthermore, any instance cookies whose
instance class is assignable to <code>Lookup</code> will be treated
specially: they will be proxied to, so these sub-lookups may provide
additional instances if they match the lookup template. In order to
get the full functionality associated with such a lookup it is wise
to request presence of <code>org.netbeans.modules.settings > 1.13</code>
as that is the module that does most of the work behind <code>Lookups.forPath</code>.
To register <code>javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory</code> into
<code>Lookups.forName("my/xml/app/data")</code> add the above described dependency
and put following code in your layer file:
<pre>
&lt;folder name="my"&gt;
  &lt;folder name="xml"&gt;
    &lt;folder name="app"&gt;
      &lt;folder name="data"&gt;
        &lt;file name="ThisIsMyRegistration.instance&gt;
          &lt;attr name="instanceCreate" newvalue="pkg.ClassNameOfYourImpl"/&gt;
        &lt;/file&gt;
      &lt;/folder&gt;
    &lt;/folder&gt;
  &lt;/folder&gt;
&lt;/folder&gt;
</pre>

<p>
In fact the <code>Lookups.forPath</code> can be used in completely 
standalone mode. This is not very recommended in the NetBeans IDE, but 
can be found pretty useful when using this library in standalone applications:
<code>Lookups.forPath(path)</code> scans all instances registered in the 
<a href="#service-lookup">META-INF/services style</a> just it uses
<code>META-INF/namedservices/path</code> prefix instead.
(<code>@ServiceProvider</code> supports this mode.)
As a result to
perform a successfull search for all <code>javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory</code> 
inside <code>Lookups.forName("my/xml/app/data")</code> one can register the
implementation into <code>META-INF/namedservices/my/xml/app/data/javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory</code>.
</p>

<p>The most powerful way to provide a lookup is to directly define
what instances and items it should provide, by subclassing. For this,

<a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/lookup/AbstractLookup.html"><code>AbstractLookup</code></a>

is recommended as it is easiest to use.

<p>The simplest way to use <code>AbstractLookup</code> is to use its
public constructor (in which case you need not subclass it). Here you
provide an

<a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/lookup/AbstractLookup.Content.html"><code>AbstractLookup.Content</code></a>

object which you have created and hold on to privately, and which
keeps track of instances and permits them to be registered and
deregistered. Often

<a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/lookup/InstanceContent.html"><code>InstanceContent</code></a>

is used as the content implementation. To add something to the lookup,
simply use

<a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/lookup/InstanceContent.html#add-java.lang.Object-"><code>add(Object)</code></a>

(and <code>remove(Object)</code> for the reverse). These may be called
at any time and will update the set of registered instances (firing
result changes as needed).

<p>In case it is expensive to actually compute the object in the
lookup, but there is some cheap "key" which can easily generate it,
you may instead register the key by passing in an

<a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/lookup/InstanceContent.Convertor.html"><code>InstanceContent.Convertor</code></a>.

This convertor translates the key to the real instance that the lookup
client sees, if and when needed. For example, if you have a long list
of class names and wish to register default instances of each class,
you might actually register the class name as the key, and supply a
convertor which really loads the class and instantiates it. This makes
it easy to set up the lookup, but nothing is really loaded until
someone asks for it.

<h3><a name="settings">Settings</a></h3>

<em>Settings</em> require special support in the lookup system: these
are objects (perhaps singletons but not necessarily) which should be
made available to lookup, yet whose content can be changed and stored
to disk (typically as a result of user interaction with the GUI).
<samp>*.instance</samp> files and similar constructions are fine for
registering fixed objects from layer - "fixed" in the sense that while
the user might copy, delete, move, or reorder them, the actual object
they provide is statically determined and does not generally have a
means of being modified. In contrast, settings have nontrivial
content. A typical setting is a system options,
simply a singleton bean with a set of properties and a structured GUI
presentation driven by <code>BeanInfo</code>.

<p>In order to save such settings, an XML file is normally used, and
the APIs provide a convenient

<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/dtds/sessionsettings-1_0.dtd">DTD</a>

for settings which can be represented as a single bean. In typical
usage, the module layer declares an initial settings file which
instructs lookup to create a <em>default instance</em> of the settings
class. This might look like the following:

<pre>
&lt;?<span class="keyword">xml</span> <span class="variable-name">version</span>=<span class="string">"1.0"</span>?&gt;
&lt;!<span class="keyword">DOCTYPE</span> <span class="type">settings</span> <span class="keyword">PUBLIC</span> <span class="string">"-//NetBeans//DTD Session settings 1.0//EN"</span> <span class="string">"http://www.netbeans.org/dtds/sessionsettings-1_0.dtd"</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="function-name">settings</span> <span class="variable-name">version</span>=<span class="string">"1.0"</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">module</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"com.foo/1"</span> <span class="variable-name">spec</span>=<span class="string">"1.0"</span>/&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">instanceof</span> <span class="variable-name">class</span>=<span class="string">"org.openide.options.SystemOption"</span>/&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">instanceof</span> <span class="variable-name">class</span>=<span class="string">"com.foo.MyOption"</span>/&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">instance</span> <span class="variable-name">class</span>=<span class="string">"com.foo.MyOption"</span>/&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">settings</span>&gt;
</pre>

Such a file might be placed in
<samp>Services/com-foo-my-settings.xml</samp> (the exact name inside
the <samp>Services</samp> folder is not important but ought to be
globally unique to avoid conflicts with other modules). It provides
an <code>InstanceCookie</code> with the settings object as instance.

<p>The interesting parts of this file are:

<ul>

<li>The <samp>&lt;instance/&gt;</samp> element which declares that the
actual object will be a default instance of the class
<samp>com.foo.MyOption</samp>, i.e. created via default public
constructor.

<li>Various <samp>&lt;instanceof/&gt;</samp> elements which specify
what lookup templates will find this instance. Giving these elements
permits the system to defer creating the setting instance until it is
actually requested (that is, using

<a href="#instancecookie-of"><code>InstanceCookie.Of</code></a>).

It is only necessary to indicate superclasses and interfaces that you
actually expect someone to look up when searching for this setting,
but be careful that you know what these might be. The actual class
of the instance itself should be listed as well.

<li>An optional but recommended <samp>&lt;module/&gt;</samp> element
that declares which module provides this setting. You give the full
code name (including a slash followed by the major release version, if applicable)
of the module and its specification version. The purpose of
this element becomes apparent if the user ever customizes the setting
file, thus writing the changes to disk (for example in the
<samp>system/Services/</samp> folder), and then uninstalls the module:
keeping the name of the declaring module in the file ensures that with
the module uninstalled, the system will quietly ignore the stale
setting rather than trying to blithely load the settings class and
failing with a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>. If the module is
subsequently reinstalled, the setting will automatically become active
again (regain its <code>InstanceCookie</code>). Similarly, settings will
not be loaded if they were written by a newer version of the module than
the one currently installed - module-supplied settings should be readable
by newer versions of the module, but generally not older ones.

</ul>

<p>There are actually three ways that the instance may be declared:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Using <samp>&lt;instance/&gt;</samp> as above to generate a
default instance. This is most common.</p>

<li><p>You may pass an additional attribute <code>method</code>
indicating a static method to call to produce
the instance, rather than using a default constructor.
The method may either be a simple name, in which case it is assumed
to be a method in the class given by <code>class</code>, or you
may give a full class name followed by a dot and method name to invoke
a static method from some other class.
The method may
optionally take a <code>FileObject</code> argument which will be the
settings file itself. This is analogous to the mechanism used for
creating complex <samp>*.instance</samp> files. For example:</p>

<pre>
&lt;<span class="function-name">file</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"some-difficult-to-make-instance.settings"</span>&gt;
    &lt;![<span class="keyword">CDATA</span>[&lt;?<span class="keyword">xml</span> <span class="variable-name">version</span>=<span class="string">"1.0"</span> <span class="variable-name">encoding</span>=<span class="string">"UTF-8"</span>?&gt;
&lt;!<span class="keyword">DOCTYPE</span> <span class="type">settings</span> <span class="keyword">PUBLIC</span>
          <span class="string">"-//NetBeans//DTD Session settings 1.0//EN"</span>
          <span class="string">"http://www.netbeans.org/dtds/sessionsettings-1_0.dtd"</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="function-name">settings</span> <span class="variable-name">version</span>=<span class="string">"1.0"</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">module</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"my.module/1"</span> <span class="variable-name">spec</span>=<span class="string">"1.0"</span>/&gt;

    &lt;<span class="function-name">instance</span> <span class="variable-name">class</span>=<span class="string">"my.module.MyAction"</span> <span class="variable-name">method</span>=<span class="string">"createAction"</span>/&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">settings</span>&gt;
]]&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"param"</span> <span class="variable-name">stringvalue</span>=<span class="string">"someval"</span>/&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">file</span>&gt;
</pre>

<pre>
<span class="keyword">package</span> <span class="constant">my</span>.<span class="constant">module</span>;
<span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="type">MyAction</span> <span class="keyword">extends</span> <span class="type">javax.swing.AbstractAction</span> {
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">MyAction</span>(<span class="type">String</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>) {<span class="comment">/* ... */</span>}
    <span class="comment">// ...
</span>    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="type">MyAction</span> <span class="function-name">createAction</span>(<span class="type">FileObject</span> <span class="variable-name">fo</span>) {
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type">MyAction</span>((<span class="type">String</span>)fo.getAttribute(<span class="string">"param"</span>));
    }
}
</pre>

<p>This will result in an instance of <code>MyAction</code> being
created with name <samp>someval</samp>.</p>

<li><p>You may use the <samp>&lt;serialdata&gt;</samp> element. Its
textual contents are a hexadecimal dump (whitespace ignored) of the
raw serialized bytes of an object to serve as the instance. Naturally
this is the least preferred mechanism as it is not human-readable.</p>

</ol>

<p class="nonnormative">(You can configure your persistance style by using
<a href="@org-netbeans-modules-settings@/org/netbeans/api/settings/ConvertAsProperties.html">@ConvertAsProperties</a> or
<a href="@org-netbeans-modules-settings@/org/netbeans/api/settings/ConvertAsJavaBean.html">@ConvertAsJavaBean</a>
instead).</p>

<p>A client can find the current setting in a couple of ways:

<ul>

<li>In the common case of <code>SystemOption</code>, you may simply
call

<a href="../SharedClassObject.html#findObject-java.lang.Class-boolean-"><code>SharedClassObject.findObject(Class,&nbsp;true)</code></a>

which will either provide a previously initialized singleton, or find
the setting in lookup if possible and read any customized state before
returning it. You may then use property change listeners as needed to
listen for changes.

<li>Just ask the system lookup for the settings class (or a relevant
superclass). This can be used to retrieve non-singleton settings; use
the lookup result to track changes in the list of setting instances,
and some ad-hoc method to track runtime changes in individual
instances.

</ul>

<p>How does the customization of setting instances work? After finding a
setting instance via this DTD, the system will automatically look for
a beans-style event set of type <code>PropertyChangeListener</code>,
and add its own listener. If the bean changes state (either
programmatically or as a result of user manipulation), the property
change will cause the new state to be written out to the original XML
file, keeping the same name. (Normally this would mean the XML would
be written to disk in the user directory.)</p>

<p class="nonnormative">(Historically the state of an object is simply
    serialized into
the XML file using <samp>&lt;serialdata&gt;</samp>, meaning the class
must be <code>Serializable</code>, but you can choose different form
of persistance by using
<a href="@org-netbeans-modules-settings@/org/netbeans/api/settings/ConvertAsProperties.html">@ConvertAsProperties</a> or
<a href="@org-netbeans-modules-settings@/org/netbeans/api/settings/ConvertAsJavaBean.html">@ConvertAsJavaBean</a>
instead).</p>

<p>Conversely, changes to the setting file on disk should trigger a
reload of the state and modification of the in-memory bean (or
creation of a new instance cookie with a new bean).</p>

<h3><a name="lookup-ui">UI for Services</a></h3>

<p>There are several things you can do to not only have services and
lookup function programmatically but also look good and behave nicely
within the user's view of configuration options and settings.</p>

<h4><a name="service-templates">Service Templates</a></h4>

<p>For many kinds of services, especially <code>ServiceType</code>s
but also others, it is necessary to permit the user to create new
instances of the service. Generally two criteria should be met for
such services:</p>

<ol>

<li>The service is not a singleton, so it is meaningful to have more
than one instance.

<li>The service has some user-configurable properties, so it is useful
to have more than one instance.

</ol>

<p>Creation of new service instances may be supported simply by
producing a template residing beneath
<samp>Templates/Services/</samp>. If the service normally resides in a
subfolder of services, for example <samp>Services/Executor/</samp>,
then the template should correspondingly be placed in
<samp>Templates/Services/Executor/</samp>.</p>

<div class="nonnormative">

<p>The template should work like regular source code templates do: a
file giving the initial structure of the service (typically a
<samp>*.settings</samp> file), with the file attribute
<code>template</code> set to <samp>true</samp>, and optionally a
<code>templateWizardDescription</code> and
<code>templateWizardURL</code>. For example:</p>

<pre>
&lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Templates"</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Services"</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Executor"</span>&gt;
            &lt;<span class="function-name">file</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"my-module-executor.settings"</span> <span class="variable-name">url</span>=<span class="string">"executor.settings"</span>&gt;
                &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"template"</span> <span class="variable-name">boolvalue</span>=<span class="string">"true"</span>/&gt;
                <span class="comment">&lt;!-- SystemFileSystem.localizedName and SystemFileSystem.icon as usual --&gt;</span>
            &lt;/<span class="function-name">file</span>&gt;
        &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
    &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
</pre>

<p>If the user selects <b>New&nbsp;From&nbsp;Template</b> on the
corresponding options folder, the template will be available.</p>

</div>

<!-- XXX is the file attribute 'simple'=false supported? Yarda says it was a hack only -->

<h4><a name="service-mirroring">Services display area and mirroring</a></h4>

<p>In addition to providing services, it is desirable to display them
to the user as well. This is done, as is customary in other aspects of
NetBeans configuration, by displaying customized variants of the data
nodes coming from the system filesystem. The root folder for
displaying options is called <samp>UI/Services/</samp>. Its subfolders
govern the display of the options available in the system.</p>

<p>As a rule, it is undesirable to place any actual settings in this
folder (nor would they be recognized by the default lookup anyway).
That is because the organization of this folder is driven by UI needs,
without regards to API maintenance or compatibility of persisted user
settings. So this folder solely <em>mirrors</em> configuration
available elsewhere. You may freely reorganize the mirror according to
current UI needs: existing modules plugging into services areas will
continue to work unmodified, and existing user customizations stored
to disk will continue to apply, since both of these act on the
original files (which should <em>not</em> be moved frivolously).</p>

<div class="nonnormative">

<p>While technically you could place anything you wish in the UI
folder, in practice a few types of things are used:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Symbolic links to settings files displayed elsewhere. In
NetBeans' old-style options, these will appear as the real setting. For example:</p>

<pre>
&lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"UI"</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Services"</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Editing"</span>&gt;
            &lt;<span class="function-name">file</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"my-module-config.shadow"</span>&gt;
                &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"originalFile"</span> <span class="variable-name">stringvalue</span>=<span class="string">"Services/my-module-Config.settings"</span>/&gt;
                &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"originalFileSystem"</span> <span class="variable-name">stringvalue</span>=<span class="string">"SystemFileSystem"</span>/&gt;
            &lt;/<span class="function-name">file</span>&gt;
        &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
    &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
</pre>

<!-- XXX this info should be in a normative section -->
<p>The attribute "originalFileSystem" can be omitted. In this case the search for the
linked file will be done on the Filesystem on which the link resides, which
is wanted for the usages on SystemFileSystem. The link file should have zero length.<BR>
Note that any localized display name
and icon should be set on the original settings file; they will be
picked up automatically by the shadow.</p>

The older style of linking using the CDATA section is still supported:

<p>This defines a folder <samp>Stuff</samp> in the system filesystem
which may be used for some kind of special configuration, and displays
it in options.</p>

<li><p>Specialized nodes. In some cases you do not wish to display a
particular folder but want to have complete control over the literal
display of the option. In such a case you need only include a
<samp>*.instance</samp> file with an instance of the node (or its
handle, if you prefer), as the node delegate of this object will be (a
clone of) the node you provide. For example:</p>

<pre>
&lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"UI"</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Services"</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Building"</span>&gt;
            <span class="comment">&lt;!-- Some subclass of org.openide.nodes.Node: --&gt;</span>
            &lt;<span class="function-name">file</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"my-module-ConfigurationNode.instance"</span>/&gt;
        &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
    &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
</pre>

</ul>

</div>

<p>No particular substructure of <samp>UI/Services/</samp> is defined
by the APIs. For optimal UI integration you may wish to examine the
categories used by other modules and try to reuse an existing category
appropriate to your needs.</p>

<p>In some cases it is necessary to <em>hide</em> a service file, or a
whole folder of services. While you can place files into
<samp>Services/</samp> and simply not make any corresponding mirror in
<samp>UI/Services/</samp>, you may wish to create services or
subfolders inside existing displayable folders (for purposes of
lookup, generally) yet not have them be visible in the UI. In this
case you should mark the file or subfolder with the file attribute
<code>hidden</code> (set to boolean <samp>true</samp>).</p>

<h4><a name="services-proped">Property editor for services</a></h4>

<p>If you wish to permit the user to select a service as part of the
Property Sheet (from a node property, or as a
<code>PropertyPanel</code>, providing general GUI embeddability), this
is supported. You should use the property editor assigned to
<code>java.lang.Object</code> (<em>not</em> your desired service
interface). Various hints defined in the Explorer API
permit you to control the result.</p>

<div class="nonnormative">

<p>As an example, here is a node property permitting you to ask the
user to select a value of type <code>my.module.Thing</code>, being
some interface or abstract superclass, where some instances are
registered to lookup, conventionally in the
<samp>Services/Things/</samp> folder which the module has provided:</p>

<p>A property extending this class would in the current UI display a
pull-down list of all <code>Thing</code> implementations available in
lookup; the custom property editor dialog would display the
<samp>Things</samp> folder with anything contained inside it for the
user to select from, provided it in fact had an instance assignable to
<code>Thing</code>. The special null value is explicitly permitted
here and would be displayed with the label given in the bundle.</p>
