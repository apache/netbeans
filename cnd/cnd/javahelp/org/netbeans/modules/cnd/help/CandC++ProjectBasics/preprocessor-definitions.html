<h2>Preprocessor Definitions Dialog Box</h2>
<p><b>To add a preprocessor definition, do one of the following:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Click Add and type the preprocessor definition in the
Add text field of the Edit dialog box. Do not use a <tt>-D</tt> flag.
Specify only the name of the definition and a value if applicable. Add
a separate entry for each definition.</li>
<li>Select an existing preprocessor definition and click Duplicate. Then
click Edit, modify the definition in the Edit dialog box, and click OK.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjust the order of the definitions by using the Up and Down buttons.</p>
<p>If you are setting preprocessor definitions for a file, definitions are
inherited from the file's project by default. If you do not want the
file to inherit preprocessor definitions from the project, click the
Inherit from Project checkbox to remove the checkmark.
