        <h3>GSF Classpath</h3>
        <p>
            <blockquote style="background-color: #ffdddd; color: black; padding: 20px; border: solid 1px black">
                WARNING: GSF has its own Classpath copy of the Java one, slightly renamed
                and in a different package. However, in NetBeans 6.5, the Java Classpath
                module has been moved from the java cluster into the IDE cluster and should
                be generic. I plan to retrofit GSF to use the standard Classpath package
                as soon as possible.

                NOTE 2: The class path and project integration aspects of GSF are really half baked
                at this point. It works, but it's not pretty, and this is an area that I <b>know</b>
                will need to change and I plan to do something about it.

        <p>
            The GSF classpath API sits in its own module and its own package: <code>gsfpath.api</code>.
            It's a pretty small API. All it boils down to this this:  For each project type
            (Ruby Project, Web Project for JavaScript, Groovy project for Groovy, etc.) you have
            to tell GSF where your sources are. The way you do this is to register a
            "project open hook", a callback provided by the project system which will call custom
            code after the project is opened.  In the project open hook, you register a series
            of directories with GSF. That's really the gist of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, it's not the 3 lines it sounds like. What you actually have to register
            are "Classpath" objects, one for each source root, and one for each library.
            A classpath has both a directory/url, as well as a "type", such as "SOURCE" or "BOOT".
            A "SOURCE" classpath is exactly what you expect - it's a root directory for sources
            in your project. "BOOT" on the other hand designates a library. As explained in the
            <a href="indexer.html">indexing</a> document, these can be treated differently by
            the code. Some features may only want to search local project sources, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            What you end up doing is something like the following (I will use the Rails project
            as an example):
            <ol>
                <li>Implement an implementation of a ClasspathProvider 
                    (org.netbeans.modules.gsfpath.spi.classpath.ClassPathProvider).
                    In the Rails case, this is the ClassPathProviderImpl class in ruby.railsproject.
                    I will describe this class in more detail below.
                </li>
                <li> Register the ClassPathProviderImpl in your project's lookup.
                <li> In your project's <code>open</code> hook, register your class path
                    with the global path registry, like this:
                    <pre>
    ClassPathProviderImpl cpProvider = getLookup().lookup(ClassPathProviderImpl.class);
    GlobalPathRegistry.getDefault().register(ClassPath.BOOT, cpProvider.getProjectClassPaths(ClassPath.BOOT));
    GlobalPathRegistry.getDefault().register(ClassPath.SOURCE, cpProvider.getProjectClassPaths(ClassPath.SOURCE));
                    </pre>             
                </li>
                <li>
                    Similarly. in your project's <code>close</code> hook, unregister the paths:
                    <pre>
    ClassPathProviderImpl cpProvider = getLookup().lookup(ClassPathProviderImpl.class);
    GlobalPathRegistry.getDefault().unregister(ClassPath.BOOT, cpProvider.getProjectClassPaths(ClassPath.BOOT));
    GlobalPathRegistry.getDefault().unregister(ClassPath.SOURCE, cpProvider.getProjectClassPaths(ClassPath.SOURCE));
                    </pre>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            That's basically it. So the only trick here is implementing the <code>ClasspathProvider</code>.
            Take a look at the one in the Rails project, or the Web project (<code>web.project</code>), etc.
            It's not rocket science. You just have to do whatever it takes for the specific project type
            to look up the source roots, decide whether all of these are relevant for your file type
            (for example, in Web projects, I only register the web folder for JavaScript, not the src folder
            which just contains Java code) and then produce classpath implementation objects for these.
            There are utility methods to help.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I warned in the red box above, this will probably change soon.
