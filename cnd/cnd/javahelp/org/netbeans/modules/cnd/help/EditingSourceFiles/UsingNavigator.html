       Using the Navigator Window
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
       The Navigator window provides a compact view of the file that is currently selected, and
      simplifies navigation between different parts of the file.
    </p>
    <p>
       Each element is marked with an <a href="Icons.html">icon</a> to identify its type.
    </p>
    <p>
       By default, the Navigator window is located in the lower lefthand corner of the IDE's
      workspace below the Projects and Files windows. To open the Navigator window, choose Window
      &gt; Navigating &gt; Navigator.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To display a source file or a Makefile in the Navigator window:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Select the file in the Editor window, the Projects window, or the Files window.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>To navigate to an element displayed in the Navigator window:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Double-click the element in the Navigator window and the cursor in the Editor window moves
        to that element.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right-click the element in the Navigator window and select Go to Source to perform the same
        action.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right-click the element and select Find Usages to find other locations where the selected
        element is used, in the project or in all open projects.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>To modify an element displayed in the Navigator window:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Right-click an element that you want to change and select one of the following:
      </li>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Select Rename if you want to rename this element and optionally refactor the project to
            make the change occur throughout the project.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select Change Function Parameters if you want to modify the parameters of a function
            and refactor.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>To change the Navigator window display:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Right-click anywhere inside the Navigator window and select options to modify the way the
        elements are sorted:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sort by Name to sort alphabetically
          </li>
          <li>
            Sort by Source to sort in the order in which the declarations occur in the source
          </li>
          <li>
            Group by Kind to sort the elements into groups according to their types
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        You can select multiple sorts. Sorts that are in effect are indicated by checkmarks before
        the options in the list.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right-click and select Kind Filters to select the types of elements you want the Navigator
        window to show.
      </li>
