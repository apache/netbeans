<a href="http://top/org/openide/options/doc-files/api.html"><em>System options</em></a>

provide an easy-to-use mechanism for persistent storage of
user-settable options.

It is possible to write new options (or access existing ones) using
the

<a href="http://top/org/openide/options/doc-files/api.html"><b>Options API</b></a>.

<p>Each option is a singleton class defined by its Bean
properties. These properties are displayed to the user in special
nodes in the Explorer, so that they may be examined and modified,
possibly triggering live changes.

<p>Special support is provided for "safe" serialization (with better
failure modes than the default) for writing options to disk;
hierarchical option clusters; and veto-aware options.
