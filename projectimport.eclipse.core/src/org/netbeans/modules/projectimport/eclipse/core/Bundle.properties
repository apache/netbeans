MSG_NotValidPlatformsInNB=There are not any valid platforms found in NetBeans. Unable to continue.
MSG_LibraryDoesnExist=Eclipse project "{0}" claims to use a library from the "{1}" directory. But this directory does not exist. To correct this Eclipse project discrepancy please find and import the library manually.
