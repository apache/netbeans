# This file contains localized strings used in this package.  The typical
# NetBeans pattern is to use one bundle per-package, called Bundle.properties;
# the openide class NbBundle supports this usage.
#
# Typically, fetch a resource as follows:
# NbBundle.getMessage (MyClass.class, "SOME_Key");
#
# Don't bother caching strings or worse, static references to resource bundles - 
# this may seem like its faster, but it wastes memory and slows things down
# in the long run.

MSG_NonPublicClassAsEntity=JPA: class must be public.
MSG_FinalClassAsEntity=An entity class may not be final.
MSG_HasNoNoArgConstructor=The class should have a no-arg, public or protected constructor.
MSG_NestedClassAsEntity=An entity class must be a top level class.
MSG_NonSerializableClass=An entity or IdClass class should implement the java.io.Serializable interface.
MSG_InnerClassAsIdClass=An inner class cannot be used as an IdClass. \
Make it a nested static class.
MSG_IdClassDoesNotOverrideEquals=The IdClass must override equals(Object o) and hashCode() method.
MSG_IdClassDoesNotOverrideHashCode=The IdClass does not override hashCode() method.
MSG_NoIdDefinedInHierarchy=There is no ID defined for this entity hierarchy.
MSG_MissingIdField=The following fields are only found in IdClass:[ {0} ]
MSG_MissingIdProperty=The following accessors are only found in IdClass:[ {0} ]
Msg_NoIdClass=There are multiple IDs in this entity class, but no IdClass is defined.
MSG_ClassNamedWithJavaPersistenceQLKeyword=The entity table name is a reserved Java Persistence QL keyword.
MSG_InvalidPersistenceQLIdentifier=The The entity table name is not a valid Java Persistence QL identifier.
MSG_ClassNamedWithReservedSQLKeyword=The entity table name is a reserved SQL-99 keyword.
MSG_IdClassUsedByNonEntity=This class cannot use IdClass because it is neither \

MSG_MissingPersistenceUnitHint=The project does not contain a persistence unit
MSG_InconsistentAccessType=The class must use a consistent access type (either field or property).
MSG_NonUniqueEntityName=Duplicated entity name. Class {0} is using the same name.
