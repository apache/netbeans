<H2>Simple DTD based Completion Grammar Package</H2>

This package implements simple DTD grammar. It means
that the grammar can resolve queries by using no
document context. It means that if a content model declaration
prescribes a sequence and a document already contains
starting sequence members the grammar will provide
these also because it does not support document context.

<p>
This simplification is same as for HTML grammar provided
by editor module.
<p>On the other hand there it prepared class {@link ContentModel}
that handles it. It is ready to be integrated.
