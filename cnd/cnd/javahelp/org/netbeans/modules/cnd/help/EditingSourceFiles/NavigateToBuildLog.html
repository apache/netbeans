    <h2>
       Navigate to Build Log from a Compiler Hint
    </h2>

    <p>
       If your code shows compiler hints or warnings and displays a light-bulb icon in&nbsp;the
      left margin, you can easily navigate to the build log for more information about the warning.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To jump to the build log for details about a compiler warning:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Place the mouse cursor on the affected line and press Alt+Enter.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the popup menu displays, select "Show in Output" for the compiler warning you want to
        investigate.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       The IDE&nbsp;shows the Output window displaying the build log and scrolls to the matching
      compiler output for the compiler warning. &nbsp;
