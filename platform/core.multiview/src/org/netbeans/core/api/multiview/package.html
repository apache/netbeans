MultiView API lets the developers create new multiview components
(without specifying their content), manipulate existing multiview
components, eg. examine what is inside the component, request focus for
one of the views etc.<br>
This API allows to access the multiview component's content.<p>
To query if a TopComponent is a multiview component, use
{@link org.netbeans.core.api.multiview.MultiViews#findMultiViewHandler}.
If a {@link org.netbeans.core.api.multiview.MultiViewHandler} instance is
returned, it is a multiview component.<br>
<code>MultiViewHandler</code> can be used to examine the multiview component. <br>
Array
of defined perspectives (elements) and the currently selected
perspective are available.&nbsp; <br>
The handler can be used to switch the
current selection programatically.<br>
<br>
Possible usecases include: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Deciding wheather a certain TopComponentGroup shall be visible or
not.</li>
  <li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
