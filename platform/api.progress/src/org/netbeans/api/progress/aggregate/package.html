<body>
Advanced progress manipulation, allowing to construct a single progress indication bar
from multiple, possibly independent sources.<p>
<b>Note:</b> The APIs in the package resemble the APIs from the main package but are separate.
<br>
There are the same visualization options as with the regular progress indication, with additional
customization options provided.
<br>
<ul>
<li> There are multiple, possibly independent sources of task's progress.
<li> These progress sources (contributors) can be added even during the task's run.
<li> The infrastructure assures that the progressbar never steps back but recalculates the
 remaining space among the running contributors.
<li> It's possible to monitor the progress from a central place.
</ul>
