<H1>Parser Package</h1>

<p><b>Maintainer</b>: Petr Kuzel and Libor Kramolis
<p><b>Updated on</b>: 6th feb 2001
<p>

The package provides a parser suitable for XML editing tasks.
There are two parsers provided.

<ol>
<li>
A cloned implementation of Sun's JAXP 1.0 reference implementation parser.
Entity resolution is patched so it is suitable for
tools purposes (allows two-way). <b>Rejected</b>

<li>
<a href="ParserLoader.html"><tt>ParserLoader</tt></a> represents a <b>izolator</b> implemented as
filtering class loader for particular Xerces implementation.
It will replace almost whole package in future.
