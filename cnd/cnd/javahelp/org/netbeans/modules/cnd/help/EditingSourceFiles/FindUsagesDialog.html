<h2>Find Usages Dialog Box</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Find Usages dialog box lets you specify search options for
the Find Usages command. You can use the Find Usages command (Alt-F7) to
display in the Usages window all of the places a class (structure),
function, variable, macro, or file is used in your project's source code.
</p>
<p>To open the Find Usages dialog box,
right-click a class, method, or field in the Source Editor,
and choose Find Usages.
</p>
<p>The Find Usages dialog box displays the following option for all
types of identifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Search in Comments.</b> If you select this option, occurrences of
the identifier that appear in code comments are also displayed in
the Usages window.
</li>
</ul>
<p>For classes, the Find Usages dialog box displays the following
additional options:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Find Usages.</b> If selected, all usages of the
class are displayed.
</li>
<li><b>Find All Subtypes.</b> If selected, usages of
all subtypes, including subtypes of subtypes, are displayed. Usages
of the class itself are not displayed.
</li>
<li><b>Find Direct Subtypes Only.</b> If selected,
only usages of direct subtypes are displayed. Subtypes of those
subtypes are ignored.
</li>
</ul>
<p>For methods, the Find Usages dialog box displays the following additional
options:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Find Usages.</b> If selected, all usages of the
method are displayed.
</li>
<li><b>Find Overriding Methods.</b> If selected, the Usages window shows
    every usage of a method that overrides this method in your project.
</li>
<li><b>Search from Base Class [<i>classname</i>].</b>
    This option is only relevant if the method for which you are finding usages
    overrides another method. If selected, the Usages window shows every usage of
    that base method.
</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the scope of the search is the current project. You can expand
the search to all of your open projects by selecting Open Projects from
the Scope drop-down list.
