 * Schema2BeansRuntimeException
 * I'd rather this class didn't exist.  I wanted to change the API to throw
 * proper exceptions, but this is difficult to do with so many users of
 * this library.  This class exists to fill in where I found it
 * difficult to throw a normal Schema2BeansException, since anything
 * that inherits from RuntimeException doesn't have to be caught.
 *
 * With that being said, there are a few times when a RuntimeException
 * would be approbate enough, but I used Schema2BeansRuntimeException
 * as it has more features.
