/** A set of interfaces which define the contract for different types of
 * components that can display or edit properties.  There is the base interface
 * for any component that can display a property, and sub interfaces describing
 * aspects such as editability.  Eventually this interfaces and a factory
 * should become public as a replacement for PropertyPanel - they are much
 * more straightforward in terms of setting expectations correctly about
 * the behavior of the underlying component.
 * <p>
 * Note that to avoid making them public, the subinterfaces have been factored
 * out for the time being.
