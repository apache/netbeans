<h2>XML Model SPIs</h2>

The SPI defines an interface of <code>GrammarQuery</code> provider.
Once registered (the registration methods depends on particular
client) it can reply to queries that can be resolved with a
grammar knowledge. It reuses DOM interfaces for context definition
however their semantics can be slightly changed. Most notably the DOM
is read-only and may throw <code>DOMException.UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION</code> from
more methods than defined by DOM IDLs.

<h3>How to Register a Provider</h3>

Default <code>GrammarQuery</code> registration mechanism uses
Lookup. Modules providing an implementation can register
{@link org.netbeans.modules.xml.api.model.GrammarQueryManager} at default filesystem. Such
registration can be than located by clients using
{@link org.netbeans.modules.xml.api.model.GrammarQueryManager#getDefault} which returns
an implementation proxing to registered ones.

<h2>XML Code Completion ("XCC") SPI Requirements</h2>

<h3>XML Phenomens to be Completed</h3>

<ul>
<li>pairing end tag  (must be solved by a client)
<li>element name and content
<li>attribute name and value (enumerated, ...)
<li>namespace prefix (namespaces declared)
<li>general reference name
<li>parameter reference name
<li>prolog content (must be solved by a client)
</ul>

<h3>XCC Context</h3>

All bellow can be described by read-only DOM Node context.

<ul>
<li>Current namespace (possibly derived from parents)
<li>Parents
<li>Siblings
<li>Attributes (what about default ones)
</ul>

Document content that is not described by DOM Node that must be extra handled
by a client:

<dl>
<dt>Entity Prolog <dd>extra handling is easy no grammar required
<dt>DTD Stuff <dd>what about it? exclude this support in GrammarQuery
</dl>
Document DTD if any (note it is a responsibility of a binder)

<h3>XCC Interface</h3>

XCC behaviour should be pluggable, XML module should provide
a default implementation for:

<dl>
<dt>well formed document <dd>document history based completion (at least pairing tags)
<dt>DTD grammar based completion <dd>content is forced by a DTD grammar
<dt>Schema grammar based completion <dd>must be namespace aware
</dl>

Particular XCC plugins can add some well-known global attributes at element content or
can provide information that is not provided by grammar (Ant task names and content)
or can handle new type of grammar.


<h3>Integration with Text Editor</h3>

Text editor must provide its context as virtual read-only Node representing
just edited phenomenon (therefore itself invalid).

<h4>Narrowing Context</h4>
Node context can be narrowed by knowledge of characters precending caret.
<dl>
<dt>whitespace in content<dd>complete element name, the first option is pairing end tag
<dt>&lt;ns:prefix <dd>complete element name starting with the prefix defined in given ns (detect that document use : for ordinary naming)
<dt>&lt;/prefix <dd>complete pairing end tag starting with prefix
<dt>&lt;prefix <dd>complete element name or namespace starting with the prefix
<dt>[prefix after] whitespace in element start tag markup <dd>complete namespace prefix of attribute name (global) 
<dt>&amp;prefix <dd>list all declared general entities starting with prefix
<dt>pseudo attribute name in prolog <dd>complete one of: version, standalone, encoding
<dt>pseudo attribute value in prolog <dd>complete from list of known values (encodings)
</dl>


<h2>Integration with Tree Editor</h2>

<h3>Narrowing Context</h3>

All particular text field values may be used as prefix, but in this mode
all other values can be hidden.
