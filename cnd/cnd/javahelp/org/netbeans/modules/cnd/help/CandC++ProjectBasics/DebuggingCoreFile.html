<h2>Debugging a Core File
</h2>
<p>If your program is crashing, you might want to debug
the core file (the memory image of your program when it
crashed).</p>
<p><b>To load a core file into the debugger:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose Debug &gt; Debug Core File.
<p>
The Debug Core File dialog box opens.
</p>
</li>
<li>Select the local host or a remote host from the Host drop-down list.
To add a new remote host, click Hosts and define the new host
in the Remote Host Settings dialog box.
</li>
<li>Type the path name of the core file in the Core File
text field, or click the Browse button and use the Select Core File
dialog box to select the core file.
</li>
<li>Type the path name of the executable in the Executable text field.
</li>
<li>By default, the Project text field displays the name of
the selected project. If you want a different project associated with
this executable, select a project from the Project drop-down list.
If you do not want the executable associated with a project, select
&lt;no project&gt;.
<p>If you want a new project created for
the executable, select &lt;Create new project&gt;.
If you create a new project for your executable, only the executable is stored
in the project properties. You need to set the other project properties by
right-clicking the project in the Projects window and choosing Project Properties.
</p>
</li>
<li>Click Debug.
</li>
</ol>
