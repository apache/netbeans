       New Remote Host Setup Wizard: Summary

    </p>
    <p>
      The New Remote Host Setup summary page lets you specify some settings to be used in
      the IDE for the remote host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Display Name.</b> Type the name you want to display for this host. The display name is
      used anywhere the build host is listed in the IDE. By default, the display name is
      <i>username@hostname</i>, which indicates the user name you used to log in and the remote host name.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Default Tool Collection.</b> Select the tool collection that you want the IDE to use on the remote
      build host. The options in the list indicate the tool collections that the IDE was able to locate on the
      remote server. If you know that a set of tools should be available on the host, but it is not
      listed here, you might need to tell the IDE where to find it after you finish setting up the
      host. See <a href="../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/ConfiguringBuildTools.html">Configuring
      Build Tools</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Access project files via.</b> Select the method you want to use to make the
      project files accessible to the remote server.  If the project files are located
      on a shared file system where the local host and the remote host can both
      access the files, you can select System level file sharing. Otherwise you can
      select either SFTP or Automatic Copying. With SFTP the IDE copies all project
      files to the remote host the first time you build the project. On subsequent builds
      on the remote host, the IDE copies only changed files.  With Automatic Copying, the IDE
      can on demand automatically copy the necessary files between the local and remote hosts.
      Automatic Copying only copies when the remote host needs to open the files. This means
      that files that are not needed to build are never copied to the remote host and the first build
      begins sooner than with SFTP.
    </p>
    <p>Click Finish.</p>
    <p>The Build Hosts Manager dialog box displays the list of build hosts
with the new remote host added.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> If the projects you build on the remote host are graphical applications,
        select the host in the Build Hosts Manager dialog and click Properties. Select
        Enable X11 Forwarding and click OK. This allows you to run the application on
        the remote host, and have the windows shown on your local desktop.</p>
