<h1>Property Sheet Reference</h1>

This document details a few ways in which the Property Sheet can be customized
or affected by system properties, UI manager keys, non-normative hints from
Nodes and such.

<h2 id="jvmflags">System properties that affect the behavior of the Property Sheet</h2>
<p>Note that generally these flags may or may not be supported in
future versions.  The following flags may be passed to the JVM
in the form <code>runide -J-Dsome.property=true</code> which
affect the user interface of the Property Sheet.  Generally they
represent either cases where different applications have different
requirements, or where there is some contention about which style
is the most effective.
<UL>
<LI><b>netbeans.ps.noCustomButtons</b> - Do not display custom editor buttons
    for properties unless the user has clicked the property to put it into
    edit mode.  This mimics the behavior of the original Property Sheet, and
    looks somewhat cleaner, but has the side effect that properties are not
    automatically updated by clicking on a checkbox, and combo box
    editors do not automatically open on the first click.</LI>
<LI><b>netbeans.ps.forceRadioBoolean</b> - always use a radio button editor for
    boolean/Boolean properties, instead of a checkbox</LI>
<LI><b>netbeans.ps.noCheckboxCaption</b> - do not display a caption on checkbox 
    boolean editors displayed in the Property Sheet</LI>
<LI><b>netbeans.ps.hideSingleExpansion</b> - In sort-by-category mode, hide the
    category expander for nodes that posess only one set of properties</LI>
<LI><b>netbeans.ps.neverMargin</b> - Suppress the left margin of the property
    sheet - less aesthetically pleasing, but useful on small displays</LI>
<LI><b>netbeans.reusable.strictthreads</b> - diagnostic flag to force an
    exception to be thrown if code attempts to force the Property Sheet to
    paint from some thread other than the AWT event thread</LI>
<LI><b>netbeans.ps.forcetabs</b> - debugging flag which forces the property
    sheet to use tabs instead of expandable sets for all property sets</LI>
</UL>

<h2 id="uimanager">UIManager settings that affect Property Sheet display characteristics</h2>
<div class="nonnormative">
<p>The Property Sheet will look for a number of custom values in UIManager,
which may be supplied to affect its appearance, either by a themes.xml file
in the user directory, or by a custom look and feel.  It is not required that
UIManager return non-null for any of these values - they are optional for
enhancing the presentation of the Property Sheet:
</p>
<UL>
<LI><b>Tree.altbackground</b> - an alternate Color to use for every other
    line in the Property Sheet</LI>
<LI><b>PropSheet.setBackground</b> - Background color for expandable sets.  If
    not set, a color is derived from the default table background color.</LI>
<LI><b>PropSheet.setBackground</b> - Background color for expandable sets when selected.  If
    not set, a color is derived from the default table selection background color.</LI>
<LI><b>netbeans.ps.rowheight</b> - An Integer specifying a fixed height for rows
    in the Property Sheet, regardless of font size.  If not set, the height is
    derived from the font size.</LI>
<LI><b>netbeans.ps.iconmargin</b> - Integer pixel count to add to the left column 
    margin in the Property Sheet</LI>
<li><code>netbeans.ps.combohack</code>-Forces the combo box editor to use a 
    heavyweight popup window, used to solve a problem with some window managers.</li>
<li><code>netbeans.ps.forcetabs</code>-Force each property set to be displayed
    in a separate tab (normally this is done only by providing a hint from
    a PropertySet via getValue(&quot;tabName&quot;).</li>
<li><code>netbeans.ps.nevertabs</code>-Disable use of tabs in the Property Sheet
    even if the property set provides a tab name via the above mentioned hint</li>
</UL>
</div>

<h2 id="custompspsr">Customization of PropertyPanel</h2>
<div class="nonnormative">
<P>The PropertyPanel component is a generic component which will display a 
property editor for a single property - rather like a single cell of the 
Property Sheet.  There are a few non-normative client properties which may
be set on it to change its behavior, via <code>putClientProperty()</code>.</P>

<ul>
<li><code>radioButtonThreshold</code>-Integer - display a set of labelled
    radio buttons instead of a combo box if the property editor returns less
    than the specified number of tags from <code>PropertyEditor.getTags()</code></li>
<li><code>suppressCustomEditor</code>-Do not display a custom editor button
    even if the property's associated property editor supports one</li>
<li><code>useLabels</code>-Use the property's display name as the label portion
    of a checkbox boolean editor, if the property is boolean, so that there
    is some indication of keyboard focus.  If radioButtonThreshold is in use
    and a property panel will display radio buttons, this will also affect
    whether a TitledBorder is used for the group of radio buttons.</li>
</ul>
</div>  

<h2 id="tabs">Using Tabs in a Property Sheet in a stand-alone application</h2>
The Property Sheet can display different property sets in different tabs -
all sets that return the same value from <code>PropertySet.getValue("tabName")</code>
will be aggregated together on the same tab.
<p>
  
To use this functionality in a
standalone application, an implementation of <code>
org.netbeans.modules.openide.explorer.TabbedContainerBridge</code> must
be available via <code>Lookup.getDefault()</code>.  For an example, see
<code>org.netbeans.core.windows.view.ui.tabcontrol.TabbedContainerBridgeImpl</code>.
A non-functional implementation is provided if none is present via lookup,
to enable unit testing.
