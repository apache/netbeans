Support for defining project types.

<p>Each kind of project in the system needs to be loaded by a
{@link org.netbeans.spi.project.ProjectFactory}, which defines how to recognize
projects on disk, load their metadata into memory, and save their metadata back
to disk. {@link org.netbeans.spi.project.ProjectState} is used to let the
factory mark a project as being modified in memory.</p>

<p>Projects will normally put implementations of several interfaces such as
{@link org.netbeans.spi.project.ActionProvider} into their lookup.</p>
