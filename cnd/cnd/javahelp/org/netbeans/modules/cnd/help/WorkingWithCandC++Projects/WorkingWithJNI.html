       Working with JNI in Mixed Development Projects
    </h2>
    <p>
       If you have a Java project that uses JNI&nbsp;methods, you can generate a
      C++&nbsp;JNI&nbsp;project from the Java project. &nbsp;The JNI&nbsp;project implements all
      the native interfaces in Java code.
    </p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;<b>To create a C++&nbsp;JNI&nbsp;Library project:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open the Java project that uses JNI&nbsp;methods.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Project view, right-click a Java class with JNI&nbsp;methods in it and select
        Generate JNI&nbsp;Library Project.<br>

        <p>
           The New JNI&nbsp;Library Library Project dialog opens.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Type a project name and optionally change the Project Location and Tool Collection. The
        default Project Name is&nbsp;CppJNILibrary for a C++&nbsp;project.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click Finish.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       The C++ JNI&nbsp;Library project is created with default implementations of all native
      functions.
    </p>
    <p>
       The property <b>java.library.path</b> is added to the Java project's Run properties for the
      Java VM so that the new C++ library can be loaded using the call
      System.loadLibrary("name-of-your-CppJNILibrary").
    </p>
    <p>
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       The following IDE&nbsp;features are supported for the associated Java and native projects.
    </p>

        </td>

          Ctrl-click on the Java method and the code editor jumps to the C/C+ declaration or
          definition if it is found.

        <td width="50%">
          Use the&nbsp;context menu&nbsp;to automatically generate code. Right-click a Java entity and choose Mixed

          into your clipboard and you can paste it where appropriate.
          <p>
          The same works for boilerplate code to access (set or get) Java fields or call Java methods.
          Right-click on a Java field or method, then select Mixed Development &gt; Copy call method code 
          / Copy get field code / Copy set field code. The requested code is then copied into the clipboard.</p>

           If a header file for that class exists in the open C++&nbsp;projects, the
          IDE&nbsp;regenerates that existing header file.<br>
           If a header file for that class doesn't exist in the open C++ projects, the IDE asks
          you&nbsp;to choose a directory for the new header file. The IDE&nbsp;generates both the
          header and '.cpp' files in the project. The C++ file contains empty implementations of
          all functions.<br>

          If you run into a native method call while debugging Java code, you can&nbsp;step into
          it. The&nbsp;IDE will automatically attach the debugger and place a breakpoint in the
          beginning of the native method.
