       C/C++ Remote Development Modes
    </h2>
    <p>
       <a href="#seealso"><small>See Also</small></a><small>&nbsp;</small>
    </p>
    <p>
       The IDE offers three modes of remote development: <a href="#simple">simple</a>, <a href=
      "#mixed">mixed</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="#full">full</a>. The main difference between the modes
      is where the source files reside.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a name="simple">Simple Remote Development Mode</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       In simple remote development mode,&nbsp;the source files reside primarily on your local
      host. When you build your project, the source files are delivered to the remote
      Linux or Oracle Solaris host using SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).
    </p>
    <p>
       Use simple remote development if you develop mostly on local files, but your application is
      targeted at platforms such as Linux or&nbsp;Oracle Solaris. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       Simple mode provides these benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can use the same IDE for local and remote development.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can switch easily between hosts and platforms in the IDE.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can use the IDE in an SSH-only environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your mobility is improved.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>To use simple remote development:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="RemoteDevelopmentConfigureHost.html">Set up a remote build host</a>
      </li>
      <li>
          Set the remote build host's Access Project Files Via property to <b>SFTP</b> or <b>Automatic Copying</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="RemoteDevelopmentProjects.html">Set up your project to use the remote build
        host</a>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
       <a id="mixed" name="mixed">Mixed or Shared Remote Development Mode</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       In mixed or shared mode, the source files reside in a location that is shared between the
      local host and remote host using NFS, Samba, WebDAV, or another file sharing system. This
      mode is a good choice if your source files are located on a file server on a network that
      is&nbsp;accessible to your development system and target platform systems.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       The benefits of using mixed mode in this environment are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can easily switch between hosts and platforms in the IDE.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no duplication of files (caching) such as would occur in the other two modes.
      </li>
      <li>
        The network throughput will be as good as your file sharing mechanism (for example, NFS,
        Samba, or WebDAV) can provide.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>To use mixed remote development:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="RemoteDevelopmentConfigureHost.html">Set up a remote build host</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the remote build host's Access Project Files Via property to <b>System-level File
        Sharing</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="RemoteDevelopmentProjects.html">Set up your project to use the remote build
        host</a>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
       <a name="full">Full Remote Development Mode</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       In full remote mode, the source files reside on the remote host. The IDE runs on the local
      host and accesses the files using SFTP.
    </p>
    <p>
       Full remote development is useful when the remote host is set up with a development
      environment that you are sharing with other users, and accessing through remote windowing
      technologies such as VNC.
    </p>
    <p>
       The benefits of using full remote mode in this environment are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Migration from using X-window forwarding or VNC is virtually seamless.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your IDE response time improves.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are less dependent on the resources of the remote development host.
      </li>
      <li>
        A smaller load on the development host reduces the load on the server.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can create new remote projects from remote binary files.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>To use full remote development:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="RemoteDevelopmentConfigureHost.html">Set up a remote build host</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the remote build host's Access Project Files Via property to anything
        because this property is not relevant in full remote mode. SFTP is used to transfer
        files.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the <a href="RemoteDevelopmentToolbar.html">Remote Development toolbar</a> to select a
        remote host, and create remote projects, and open remote projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Work with your projects just the same as local projects.
      </li>
      <li>If you are using a version control system, see <a href="RemoteVCS.html">
              Using Full Remote Mode with Version Control Systems</a></li>
