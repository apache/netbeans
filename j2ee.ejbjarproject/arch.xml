The module exposes a new NetBeans project type to create J2EE EJB Module project, 
where a developer can add EJBs, develop them, assemble them, build them and deploy them to Application servers.
The friend API allows EAR project to create an EJB module project. It also allows the ejbcore project to set

<!-- Question: compat-i18n

     <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.

Yes.

<!-- Question: compat-standards

     <question id="compat-standards">
            Does the module implements or defines any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or it deviates somehow?
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-standards">
The module follows the J2EE 1.4 specifications. It allows the user to develop
applications conforming to this standard. The implementation is exact, in the sense that 
the module accepts any compliant Ejb Module. Since J2EE 1.4 has to be backward comaptible with J2EE 1.3, this module supports J2EE 1.3 Ejb Modules.
It does not help you create NEW 1.3 modules, but will behave nicely with 1.3 Apps, due to the API layer designed in the j2ee/ddapi module that handles more than
one specification version of J2@@.
</answer>



<!-- Question: compat-version

     <question id="compat-version">
            Does your module properly coexists with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read settings? Will future
            versions be able to read settings?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
The module stores some information into persistent data, and makes the best
effort to correctly interpret information stored by previous versions of the 
module. It is anticipated that future versions of the module will be able to
interpret information stored by the current version, whenever possible and practical.

            <hint>
            It is expected that if your module runs on 1.x that it will run 
            on 1.x+1 if no, state that please. Also describe here cases where
            you run different code on different versions of JRE and why.

<!-- Question: dep-jrejdk

     <question id="dep-jrejdk">
            Do you require JDK or is JRE enough?
        </question>
-->
<answer id="dep-jrejdk">
The module depends on the Java module (an EJB is a set fo Java files), which presumably needs the JDK
in order to cooperate with the Java compiler. The module was not tested
with the JRE.

Also, there are actions whose enabled status is complicated, e.g. the <code>Call EJB</code>
or <code>Promote Method</code> actions on EJBs, which depend on where the cursor is on the java file.

<!-- Question: perf-progress

     <question id="perf-progress">
            Does your module executes some long running task?
            <hint>Typically they are tasks like connecting over
            network, computing huge amount of data, compilation.
            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example
            using <code>RequestProcessor</code>), definitively it should 
            not block AWT thread.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="perf-progress">
It launches the compilation of EJBs, compilation of Java files, and deployment of
standalone EJB Module  Although ultimately these tasks are not directly performed 
by this module (but by cooperating modules), it can be assumed that these tasks 
will be long running.
Another long running task is the mounting of additional filesystems when an ejb module
is registered or created in the IDE.

            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.
            </hint>
        </question>

<answer id="resources-file">
Yes. The use of <code>java.io.File</code> is needed for interaction with the
Server Integration APIs, which expect it as parameters in some API calls.

<!-- Question: resources-layer

     <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create some files or

            component?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of

            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

<!-- Question: resources-read

            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.

<answer id="resources-read">
One task accomplished through reading from layers is allowing dependent modules to declaratively define 
actions displayed by this module, but provided by the dependent modules. Another task is to find out whether
certain other modules are enabled. There may be other usages too.

                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
