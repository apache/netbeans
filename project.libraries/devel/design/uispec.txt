Project Libraries UI Specification

Abstract

This paper proposes UI of libraries framework
it's based on requirements <requirements.html>
and should be integrated with Java Support UI
<JavaProjectsUISpecs.html> (I borrowed some
text from its draft).


Status
  
Formalization of sketch made by pkuzel, jrojcek
cledantec and others. An input for the revised
Java Language Support UI specs. 

There are 3 OPEN ISSUEs that must be addressed.


Primary User Tasks

T1: User must be able to manage library
    definitions
T2: User must be able to use library as
    project resource    
T3: The T2 resource must be then useable
    in particular context (e.g. classpath
    customizer)  
    
    
T1 The Library Repository    

The repository allows user to create/delete
libraries and manage their contents.

The Library Repository is accessible from the Tools menu.
This modal dialog contains a list of known libraries available
in the IDE. A library is a specific type of resource 
that points to Jars and potentially any supporting martierial
like sources, and documentation.

OPEN ISSUE 1: Project scoped libraries. Where to manage
them. Tools is a global action. On the other hand it's
good to have central libraries manager. Compromise the
manager shows libraries from all opened projects.

The library repository dialog consists from two
parts: a library selector and selected library
customizer. Content of selected library customizer
follows selected library (It may be replaced
by category description if a category is selected 
because it's not probably implementable to create
nonselectable categories.)

 +-Libraries Repository ----------------+
 |                                      |
 | +--------------+ +-----------------+ |
 | |              | |                 | |
 | | the selector | | the customizer  | |
 | |              | |                 | |
 | +--------------+ +-----------------+ |
 |                                      |
 |                    [ OK ] [ Cancel ] |
 +--------------------------------------+

where:

 [OK] applies all changes made so far and
    closes the dialog
    
 [Cancel] cancels all changes
    (NOTE implementation can ask for applying
    changes on library selection change)
 
The selector component consistes from categorized
list with two buttons:

 +------------------------------+
 | My Libraries                 ^
 |   Xerces 2.4.0               |
 | Project 3GNET Accounting     #
 |   Registry 1.2               #
 |   Regexp 1.2                 #
 |   DOM L1 HTML module         #
 | Remote 3GNET Accounting      #
 |   Web Services Pack 1.2      #
 | IDE Libraries                |
 |   XML APIs                   |
 |                              v
 +------------------------------+
 
 [ Create... ] [ Delete ]
 
where:

  "My Libraries" stays for category that contains
  libraries in user's directory.

  "Project 3GNET Accounting" and "Remote 3GNET Accounting"
  (names come from project names) are two opened projects
  that contains given library definitions (NOT usage).

  "IDE Libraries" stays for category that contains
  libraries bundled with the IDE. These are not user
  editable, actual content depends on enabled modules.

  [Create...] asks user for entering library
  name and creates empty library definition in
  given category (NOTE Category can be determined from
  selection or explicitly queried in the ask dialog.
  It future it may also ask for library type i.e.
  Java vs. C++ vs. FORTRAN.)
  
  [Delete] after confirmation deletes selected library.
  
All other elements stay for library names.

The library customizer component shows library
name, its description and content.

 +-----------------------------------------------+
 | Name:        Xerces 2.4.0______________       |
 | Description: XML parser compatible    ^       |
 |              with XML 1.1 draft, XML  #       |
 |	        Namespaces 1.1 draft and #       |
 |	        DOM3 Load/Store draft    V       |
 |  ___________	                                 |
 | / Classpath \ Sources \ Documentation \_____	 |     	       
 | |                                           | |
 | | +-----------------------------^           | |
 | | | ~/libs/xerces240/xerces.jar # [ Add    ]| |
 | | | ~/libs/xerces240/examples.j # [ Remove ]| |  
 | | |                             # [ Up     ]| |
 | | |                             | [ Down   ]| | 
 | | +-----------------------------V           | |
 | +-------------------------------------------+ |
 +-----------------------------------------------+
 
where:

  Bottom tabbed area shows library content. Number
  of tabs and their look may vary depending
  on enabled modules. Shown scenario belongs
  to typical Java IDE.
  
  [Add] let user select additional content. It'll
  typically present a filechooser. Selected item
  is appended to the library content list.
  (NOTE Implementation should open filechooser in
  context that is derived from other library content
  types if possible. Otherwise use last selection.)
  
  [Remove] after confirmation deletes selected
  list entry.
  
  [Up/Down] moves selected entry one position up/down.
  These should be available only with content that
  must be ordered like: classpath and java sources.
  

T2 Library as Project Resource

Project resources is a pool of various items
external to current project. Library is an
example of bundle of such items.

User can add and remove library usage as project
resource. Standard project resources addition/removal
task is used. The libraries specifics part
is the second step in the add resource wizard
(the one after user selected she wants to add a library
usage). This step presents available libraries
in a list.

 +--------------------------------------+
 | Please select library you wanna use  |
 | as project resource:                 |
 |                                      |
 | +----------------------------^       |
 | | Xerces 2.4.0               #       |
 | | Registry 1.2               #       |
 | | Regexp 1.2                 #       |
 | | DOM L1 HTML module         #       |
 | | Web Services Pack 1.2      #       |
 | | XML APIs                   |       |
 | |                            |       |
 | +----------------------------V       |
 |                                      |
 | [ Manage Libraries ]                 |
 +--------------------------------------+
                   .....      [ Finish ]
		      
where:

  The multiselection list contains alphabetically
  sorted library definitions.
  
  {Manage Libraries] can be used to adjust/
  inspect library definition from the wizard
  context, it opens the library repository
  manager modal dialog.
  
  [Finish] button owned by wizard framework is
  enabled if at least one library is selected.
  It puts library usage under project resources.
  
Library resource appearance (a node and its children)
should allow to browse library content or at least
provide view action showing read-only library definition.


T3 Using Library Resource in Project

OPEN ISSUE 2: This area was not well covered in
previous Java UI specs, this is my point of view
and it may need a review from educated HIE guru.

As an example I have chosen the classpath customizer:

   ___________   ______________
  / Classpath \ /Boot Classpath\          
 |             \-----------------------------------------+
 | +------------------------------------^                |
 | | /path/to/Foobar.jar                #  [ Add...    ] |
 | | [-] Xerces 2.4.0                   #  [ Remove    ] |
 | |  +--- xerces.jar                   #                |
 | |  +--- example.jar                  #  [ Move Up ]   |
 | |                                    #  [ Move Down ] |
 | |                                    |                |
 | +------------------------------------V                |
 +-------------------------------------------------------+

where:

  Xerces 2.4.0 is one item in list. It may
  be expandable and shown but by default it
  is collapsed. It must signalize its
  validity state (e.g. if resource removed).
  
  [Add] shows a project resource selector. 
  The project resource selector for classpath
  lists all project resources that can be used
  at classpath. (NOTE Classpath typing
  is given by target classpath. Project resource
  itself does not carry any such flag.)
  
All other buttons works as naturally expected.

OPEN ISSUE 3: I may be confusing that adding
library with classpath to project resources
does not have any meaning until it's placed
at first classpath. Some other resources types
such as XML catalogs has meaning right after
adding them to project resources. Project resources
play two roles. It's a repository of things
useable in project context (the classpath) and
it's also the usage itself (the XML entity).
