<!--
The netbeans-deployment element is the root element for the
netbeans-specific additions to the j2ee deployment framework.
There is one netbeans-deployment element for each vendor plugin which
further configures that plugin to work with netbeans.
-->

<!ELEMENT netbeans-deployment (
    icon, disconnected-string, container-limitation?,
    config-bean*,
    web-context-root? )>

<!--
The icon element contains a path to the icon to be used to present the server
in the server registry.

<!ELEMENT icon (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The disconnected-string element contains the String parameter to DeploymentFactory.getDisconnectedDeploymentManager()

<!ELEMENT disconnected-string (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The container-limitation element modifies a plugin to say that not all j2ee deployments are valid.
For example, a web-only server would include 
<container-limitation> <war-deploy/> </container-limitation>
to indicate that only war deployments are accepted.
If a container-limitation element is not present, all j2ee deployments are assumed valid.
If a container-limitation element is present, then only j2ee deployment types explicitly
mentioned are allowed.
