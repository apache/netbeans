        <h2>GSF Lexing</h2>
        <p>
            GSF requires you to provide a lexer for your language. The lexer should
            implement the NetBeans Lexer API.
            In addition, you have to register the lexer, as well as
            color definitions. (I'd like to remove the need for this part
            by having GSF do it for you). See the
            <a href="#registration">registration section</a> for details on this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing a lexer using the NetBeans lexing API is pretty easy.
            There is already quite a bit of documentation for the lexer itself,
            so I won't repeat any of that here.  However, GSF is often used to wrap
            languages with existing lexers and parsers which I'll get into next.
        </p>
        <h2>Wrapping Existing Lexers</h2>
        <p>
            If you are trying to add language support for a popular language,
            changes are you already have a lexer for it - and you don't want to
            write one from scratch. After all, if you're trying to support
            say Groovy, why duplicate the Groovy compiler's lexer and risk
            making mistakes such that your IDE support doesn't 100% correctly
            handle exactly the same keywords, commenting rules etc. as the 
            language?  For the Ruby support in NetBeans, I'm using the JRuby
            lexer. It turns out lexing Ruby is pretty tricky - you should take 
            a look at their lexer!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are wrapping an existing lexer there are two things you
            need to worry about. One of them is easy, the other one probably hard:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Most lexers written for these languages (Ruby, JavaScript,
                    Groovy, PHP, Scala, Python, etc.) were intended for use
                    by a parser. If you're trying to reuse a parser's lexer,
                    you'll run into a problem. Parsers don't care about 
                    whitespace and comments! Typically, they'll just throw
                    them away and only tokenize the rest of the buffer
                    that is relevant for the parser.  That won't do for your
                    IDE lexer! It must return a TokenId for ALL characters
                    in the buffer, and in particular, whitespace and comments
                    too!  Thus, you have to modify your lexer to not throw
                    these things away, but return proper tokens for them
                    instead. I modified both Rhino (for JavaScript) and JRuby
                    (for JRuby) to do this. In both cases it involved changing
                    a "continue" in a for loop (where they had just eaten
                    whitespace) to a "return whitespace/comment token") and
                    a little bit of futzing to make sure the parser would
                    correctly handle coming back from this state.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The lexer must be incremental!! This means that your lexer
                    wrapper needs to be able to restart your wrapped lexer
                    at any position in the buffer (well, at any token boundary
                    to be more exact) and continue lexing from there. This
                    is used heavily in the IDE; if you're editing a 4,000 line
                    JavaScript file, we don't start lexing from the top
                    for every character you're typing! The editor is pretty smart
                    and as soon as your token stream matches the old token
                    stream it will stop lexing again, which means that it ends
                    up doing very little work for normal typing, and if you
                    say type <code>/*</code> to start a comment, it will 
                    immediately relex the rest of the screen to reflect that
                    it's all a big comment now.
                </li>
            </ol>
            Modifying your lexer to return whitespace and token types should
            be pretty trivial. Adding incremental support might not be so
            easy. For JRuby, this involved figuring out all the state that
            is needed by the lexer, and extracting this into a separate
            state object, as space and performance efficiently as possible,
            and then stashing away one of these for each token generated.
            (The IDE makes this part easy).
            There is also really good unit testing support for the Lexer API,
            which lets you both easily do token dumps, as well as incremental
            lexing tests, where it performs random edits of your documents,
            and compares the incrementally lexed token hierarchy for each step
            with a token hierarchy obtained by lexing your entire file from
            the top and diffs the two.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want code inspiration, the RubyLexer in the 
            <code>ruby</code> module and the
            JsLexer in the <code>javascript.editing</code> module have examples
            of this was done for Ruby and JavaScript.

        <h3>Lexer Registration and Colors</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to providing your Lexer language from your language configuration
            object (as described in the <a href="registration.html">registration document</a>),
            you should probably also register the lexer language with NetBeans. This will allow
            language embedding to work more naturally because NetBeans (not just GSF) can
            locate the lexer language for a given mime type, which is used in langauge embedding
            scenarios.  <b>Yes, there is a redundancy here</b> that both GSF and the editor
            need you to register the Lexer language. Either GSF should read the information directly
            from the editor's location, or GSF should automatically register the lexer language
            on your behalf in the editor's location. I'll look into fixing this. But for now,
            add the following registration in the Editors/mimetype folder:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
    &lt;folder name="Editors"&gt;
        &lt;folder name="text"&gt;
            &lt;folder name="x-ruby"&gt;
                ...
                <b>&lt;file name="language.instance"&gt;
                    &lt;attr name="instanceCreate" methodvalue="org.netbeans.modules.ruby.lexer.RubyTokenId.language"/&gt;
                    &lt;attr name="instanceOf" stringvalue="org.netbeans.api.lexer.Language"/&gt;
                &lt;/file&gt;</b>
        &lt;/folder&gt;
    &lt;/folder&gt;
            </pre>
            So note that <code>language.instance</code> here is under the <code>Editors</code> folder,
            and refers to a Lexer Language,
            whereas the language configuration object, also in <code>language.instance</code> file,
            is under the <code>GsfPlugins</code> folder, and refers to a GsfLanguage object.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also register color definitions (as well as color registrations) for arbitrary
            <code>TokenIds</code> that your lexer is creating. Usually you'll probably want to
            just inherit as many colors from the defaults as possible, to leave color and font
            management up to the defaults supplied by the various themes.
            To register colors for the default theme, use a registration like this:
            
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
    &lt;folder name="Editors"&gt;
        &lt;folder name="text"&gt;
            &lt;folder name="x-ruby"&gt;
                ...
                <b>&lt;folder name="FontsColors"&gt;
                    &lt;folder name="NetBeans"&gt;
                        &lt;folder name="Defaults"&gt;
                            &lt;file name="coloring.xml" url="fontsColors.xml"&gt;
                                &lt;attr name="SystemFileSystem.localizingBundle" stringvalue="org.netbeans.modules.ruby.Bundle"/&gt;
                            &lt;/file&gt;
                        &lt;/folder&gt;
                    &lt;/folder&gt;</b>
                &lt;/folder&gt;
            &lt;/folder&gt;
        &lt;/folder&gt;
    &lt;/folder&gt;
            </pre>
            Here, we are referencing two other files. First, a <code>fontsColors.xml</code> file, which supplies
            a set of color definitions for our token types:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
    &lt;fontcolor name="STRING_LITERAL" default="string"/&gt;
    &lt;fontcolor name="DOUBLE_LITERAL" default="number"/&gt;
    &lt;fontcolor name="BLOCK_COMMENT" default="comment"/&gt;
    &lt;fontcolor name="DOCUMENTATION" default="comment"/&gt;
    &lt;fontcolor name="LONG_LITERAL" default="number"/&gt;
    &lt;fontcolor name="REGEXP_LITERAL" foreColor="9933CC"/&gt;
    &lt;fontcolor name="ERROR" default="error"/&gt;
    ...
            </pre>
            Here, <code>STRING_LITERAL</code> is the enum-name of the <code>TokenId</code> corresponding
            to a String literal, and so on. As you can see, in most cases we are just referring
            to logical styles like <code>string</code>, <code>number</code>, and so on. In the
            case of regular expressions, there isn't a builtin type for that, so we specify
            a custom color. The editor plans to provide a larger set of builtin definitions
            such that you shouldn't have to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Second, the color registration mentioned a particular <code>Bundle.properties</code> file,
            where the color definitions can be named. This is used for the Fonts &amp; Colors options
            dialog, where users get to click on the logical names of style definitions and 
            customize them. In your <code>Bundle.properties</code> file, you need something
            like this:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
STRING_LITERAL=String
DOUBLE_LITERAL=Double
BLOCK_COMMENT=Block Comment
STRING_TEXT=String
QUOTED_STRING_LITERAL=Quoted String
LONG_LITERAL=Long
STRING_ESCAPE=String Escape
DOCUMENTATION=Documentation
...            
            </pre>
        </p>
