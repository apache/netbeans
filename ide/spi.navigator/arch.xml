  <p>
   Navigator API is good for clients (module writers) that want to show some
   structure or outline of their document in dedicated window, allowing end user
   fast navigation and control over the document.</p>
   <p>
   API allows its clients to plug in their Swing based views easily, which 
   then will be automatically shown in specialized Navigator UI.</p>

  <p>
   Unit tests will be written ensuring that implementation loads, instantiates
   and calls client's SPI correctly. Usual manual testing will be performed as
   well. As whole API is rather small, it will be easily covered by unit tests
   as a whole.

   <usecase id="basicUsage" name="Basic Usage Steps" >
      In order to plug in a view into Navigator UI for certain document (data) type,
      module writers need to write a <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorPanel.html">NavigatorPanel</a>
      implementation marked with <code>@Registration</code>.

      <h4>Writing NavigatorPanel implementation</h4>
        <p>Implementing <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorPanel.html">NavigatorPanel</a>
         interface is easy, you can copy from template basic implementation 
        <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/navigator/doc-files/BasicNavPanelImpl_java">BasicNavPanelImpl.java</a>.</p>
        
        Advices on important part of panel implementation:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Instantiation:</b> Your implementation of NavigatorPanel
            is instantied automatically by the system if you register it using <code>@Registration</code>.</li>

            <li><b>getComponent</b> method: Simply create and return your UI
            representation of your data in Swing's JComponent envelope. Just be sure
            that you don't create new JComponent subclass per every call, as
            performance will suffer then.<p></p></li>

            <li><b>panelActivated and panelDeactivated</b> methods wraps an 
            'active' life of your panel implementation. In panelActivated, grab
            your data from given <a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/Lookup.html">Lookup</a>,
            usually by looking up its asociated
            <a href="@org-openide-loaders@/org/openide/loaders/DataObject.html">DataObject</a>
            or 
            <a href="@org-openide-filesystems@/org/openide/filesystems/FileObject.html">FileObject</a>
            to take data from. Also remember to attach listeners to lookup result,
            perhaps also to data itself and trigger UI update with new data.
            Code will typically look like this:<br></br>
            <pre>
        /** JavaDataObject used as example, replace with your own data source */
        private static final Lookup.Template MY_DATA = new Lookup.Template(JavaDataObject.class);

        public void panelActivated (Lookup context) {
            // lookup context and listen to result to get notified about context changes
            curResult = context.lookup(MY_DATA);
            curResult.addLookupListener(/** your LookupListener impl here*/);
            Collection data = curResult.allInstances();
            // ... compute view from data and trigger repaint
        }
            </pre>
            Do *not* perform any long computation in panelActivated directly, see below.<br></br>
            In panelDeactivated, be sure to remove all listeners to context given
            to you in panelActivated.<p></p></li>

            <li><b>Long computation of content:</b> What if rendering your
            Navigator view takes long time, more than several milliseconds?
            Right approach is to create and run new task using
            <a href="@org-openide-util@/org/openide/util/RequestProcessor.html">RequestProcessor techniques</a>, 
            each time when panelActivated call arrived or your listeners on 
            data context got called.<br></br>
            While computing, UI of Navigator view
            should show some please wait message.<p></p></li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Registering NavigatorPanel impl</h4>
       <p>Declarative registration of your NavigatorPanel impl connects this
        implementation with specific content type, which is type of 
        the document, expressed in mime-type syntax, for example 'text/x-java'
        for java sources. Infrastructure will automatically load and show
        your NavigatorPanel impl in UI, when <b>currently activated Node
        is backed by primary FileObject whose 
        <a href="@org-openide-filesystems@/org/openide/filesystems/FileObject.html#getMIMEType--">FileObject.getMimeType()</a>
        equals to content type specified in your registering annotation</b> (see more options below).</p>
   </usecase> 

   <usecase id="lookupHint" name="Advanced Content Registration - Linking to Node's Lookup" >
        <p>There may be situations where linking between your Navigator view and
        activated Node's primary FileObject is not enough or not possible at all.
        This simply happens when the data you want to represent in Navigator are
        not accessible through primary FileObject or DataObject. Usual example is
        Multiview environment, where more views of one document exists.</p>
         
        <p>The solution is to bind content of your Navigator view directly to your
        TopComponent. Then, whenever your TopComponent gets activated in the system, Navigator UI
        will show th content you connected to it.</p>
        
        <b>Steps to do:</b>
         
        <ul>
            <li>Choose your content type, could be either well known or arbitrary,
            say <b>'text/my-amazing-type'</b> and
            do all basic steps described in above use case.<p></p></li>
            
            <li>Implement <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorLookupHint.html">NavigatorLookupHint</a>
             interface like this:
             <pre>
        class AmazingTypeLookupHint implements NavigatorLookupHint {
            public String getContentType () {
                return "text/my-amazing-type";
            }
        }
             </pre>
             <p></p></li>
             
            <li>Alter your <a href="@org-openide-windows@/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html">TopComponent</a>
             to contain your NavigatorLookupHint implementation (AmazingTypeLookupHint in this case)
            in its lookup, returned from 
            <a href="@org-openide-windows@/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html#getLookup--">TopComponent.getLookup()</a>
             method.<p></p></li>
             
             <li>
             Another option you have is to alter lookup of your <code>Node</code> subclass 
             instead of directly altering lookup of your <code>TopComponent</code>.
             See <a href="@org-openide-nodes@/org/openide/nodes/Node.html#getLookup--">Node.getLookup()</a> method.
             Then Navigator will show your desired content whenever your <code>Node</code>
             subclass will be active in the system.<br></br>             
             However, keep in mind that this option is less preferred, because it
             only uses implementation detail knowledge that default implementation
             of <code>TopComponent.getLookup()</code> includes also results from 
             lookup of asociated <code>Node</code>. So this approach will stop
             working if you change default behaviour of <code>TopComponent.getLookup()</code> method.
             <p></p>
             </li>
             
        </ul>
   
           
   </usecase>
   
   <usecase id="activatePanel" name="Programmatic activation of NavigatorPanel" >
        <p>Programmatic activation of specific navigator panel activates and shows
            navigator panel in navigation area, as if user had selected the panel
            manually. API clients are expected to use programmatic activation to
            activate/select preferred panel from a set of available panels.</p>
        <b>Example:</b>
            Several <code>TopComponents</code> in multiview arrangement,
            <code>TopComponentA</code> and <code>TopComponentB</code>.
            Both components provide the same
            <code>NavigatorLookupHint</code> impl, which is recognized by two
            providers <code>NavigatorPanelA</code> and <code>NavigatorPanelB</code>.
            Now when <code>TopComponentA</code> becomes activated (has a focus),
            it's desirable to select/show <code>NavigatorPanelA</code> from
            navigator panels. On the other side, when <code>TopComponentB</code>
            is activated, <code>NavigatorPanelB</code> should be activated automatically.
            <p></p>
         
        <b>Steps to do to activate panel programmatically:</b>
         
        <ul>
            <li>Get the instance of <code>NavigatorPanel</code> implementation that
                you want to activate/show in navigator area.<br></br>
                See <a href="@org-openide-util@/org/openide/util/doc-files/api.html#instances">Instantiation rules</a>.<p></p>
            </li>
            
            <li>Call <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorHandler.html#activatePanel-org.netbeans.spi.navigator.NavigatorPanel-">
                NavigatorHandler.activatePanel(NavigatorPanel panel)</a><p></p>.
            </li>
             
        </ul>
           
   </usecase>
   
   <usecase id="activatedNode" name="Setting activated node of Navigator window" >
        <p>Sometimes clients need to alter activated Nodes of Navigator window,
            to better represent Navigator area content within the whole application.
            See <a href="@org-openide-windows@/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html#getActivatedNodes--">TopComponent.getActivatedNodes()</a>
            and <a href="@org-openide-windows@/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.Registry.html#getActivatedNodes--">TopComponent.Registry.html#getActivatedNodes()</a>
            to find out what activated nodes of TopComponent and whole system mean.
        </p>
        <b>Use Case Example:</b>
            NavigatorPanel implementation shows list or tree of some <code>Node</code>s
            in Navigator area. When user selects a Node in the list or tree,
            it is desirable to show selected Node's properties in Properties
            window and enable proper actions in main menu. Exactly this can be done
            by presenting Node selected in the list/tree as activated Node of 
            Navigator window.
            <p></p>
         
        <b>Steps to specify activated Nodes of Navigator window:</b>
         
        <ul>
            <li>In your implementation of <code>NavigatorPanel</code>, implement
                method <code>getLookup()</code> to return Lookup instance filled
                with Node(s) that you want to set as activated Nodes of Navigator window.
                <p></p>
            </li>
            
            <li>Be sure to update Lookup content properly, for example using
                <a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/lookup/InstanceContent.html">InstanceContent</a> as follows:
             <pre>
        class MyNavigatorPanel implements NavigatorPanel {
        
            /** Dynamic Lookup content */
            private final InstanceContent ic;
            /** Lookup instance */
            private final Lookup lookup;
            
            public MyNavigatorPanel () {
                this.ic = new InstanceContent();
                this.lookup = new AbstractLookup(ic);
            }
        
            public Lookup getLookup () {
                return lookup;
            }

            /** Call this method when activated Nodes change is needed, 
            * for example when selection changes in your NavigatorPanel's Component
            */
            private void selectionChanged (Node oldSel, Node newSel) {
                ic.remove(oldSel);
                ic.add(newSel);
            }
            
            ... impl of rest of your NavigatorPanel
            
        }
             </pre>
            </li>
             
        </ul>
           
   </usecase>

   <usecase id="undoRedo" name="Adding UndoRedo support to the navigation view" >

            edit changes done either directly in the view or in document which 
            the view is representing.
        </p>
         
        <b>Steps to support undo and redo in navigation view:</b>
         
        <ul>
            <li>Implement your navigation view as <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorPanelWithUndo.html">NavigatorPanelWithUndo</a>,

                <code>UndoRedo</code> support returned from <code>NavigatorPanelWithUndo.getUndoRedo()</code>
                is propagated to the Navigator TopComponent and returned as its

   <usecase id="panelsPolicy" name="Removing active Node/DataObject related NavigatorPanels from Navigator window" >
        <p>In certain situations it's not desired to show NavigatorPanel implementations
            related to DataObject of active Node in Navigator window. Typically
            you need to have active Node of some type, so that actions in the system
            works properly. But you don't want to show NavigatorPanels that "come"
            with such active Node. 
        </p>

        <b>Steps to remove such NavigatorPanels:</b>

        <ul>
         <li>Implement interface <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorLookupPanelsPolicy.html">NavigatorLookupPanelsPolicy</a>,
             return kind of policy that suits you from <code>getPanelsPolicy()</code> method.
             <p></p>

     <p>
        Navigator listen to system activated node changes and sets activated
        node for Navigator top component accordingly. Local activated node is
        set from system activated node if any provider agrees to display content
        for data object behind the node. Navigator relies on default lookup
        mechanism of TopComponent to populate its activated node.
        Currently it means that if node backed by JavaDataObject is activated node
        in the system, it is also activated node for Navigator's top component.
        So main menu actions like Compile File, Move Class etc. work as usual
        when Navigator window is active.
        Also, lookup of currently selected Node is searched for NavigatorPanel
        SPI instances.
