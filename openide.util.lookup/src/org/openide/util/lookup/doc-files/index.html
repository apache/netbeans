<BODY>

<P>

This is the home page of the <em>lookup library</em> implementation, which
is intended to solve a general problem that every <cite>component-based system</CITE>
has had to face: how different components <b>register</b> to the system
and how other parts of the system can <b>look</b> them <b>up</B>.
<P>
There already are libraries trying to solve this problem, usually by querying for
an interface and finding its appropriate implementaion. The most famous is
<A href="http://www.jini.org/">Jini</A>, the platform for development of
distributed network services. Our library does something similar, but tries
to stay small and easy
to use. The NetBeans <em>Lookup
Library</EM>'s main focus is a modular application consisting of independent modules
that want to communicate with each other. It does not try to solve networking or
legacy application integration. It is simple but powerful.

<H2>Why would you want to use it?</H2>

A well-written modular program separates <em>development</EM>
and <em>deployment</EM>.
There are many situations where a component needs some functionality but
does not actually care about the implementation. It is up to the <em>system
adminstrator</em> that deploys (installs) the application to decide which 
implementation to use.
<P>
The most simple and most often used method for allowing other implementations
to be plugged in is the <em>system property</em> pattern:

<pre>
    <font class="keyword">public</font> <font class="type">Toolkit</font> <font class="function-name">getDefaultToolkit</font> () {
        java.awt.<font class="type">Toolkit</font> <font class="variable-name">t</font> = <font class="constant">null</font>;
        <font class="type">String</font> <font class="variable-name">classname</font> = System.getProperty (<font class="string">"java.awt.Toolkit"</font>);
        <font class="keyword">if</font> (classname != <font class="constant">null</font>) {
            <font class="keyword">try</font> {
                <font class="type">Class</font> <font class="variable-name">c</font> = Class.forName (classname);
                t = (java.awt.<font class="type">Toolkit</font>)c.newInstance ();
            } <font class="keyword">catch</font> (<font class="type">Exception</font> <font class="variable-name">ex</font>) {
                System.out.println (<font class="string">"Cannot initialize toolkit: "</font> + classname);
                ex.printStackTrace ();
            }
        }
        <font class="comment">// fallback </font>
        <font class="keyword">if</font> (t == <font class="constant">null</font>) {
            t = <font class="keyword">new</font> <font class="type">GenericAWTToolkit</font> ();
        }
    }
</pre>

    
The idea is simple. The <em>deployer</em> can start the Java VM with the flag
<code>-Djava.awt.Toolkit=org.myorg.MyToolkit</code> where the <code>MyToolkit</code>
is his class with default constructor and the code in the <code>getDefaultToolkit</CODE>
method will instantiate the class and use it.
<P>
In principle this is general enough of a solution and works well, except that writing the 
code above is error prone and it also requires passing the arguments to the virtual machine. 
It would be much nicer if the registation could be done just by putting a JAR file with the <code>MyToolkit</code> class
into the application classpath.
<P>
Actually this has been realized also by the JDK development team and addressed in
JDK 1.3 as part of the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jar/jar.html#Provider%20Configuration%20File">provider extension mechanism</A>. 
The <code>MyToolkit</code> could be registered by adding a file 
<code>/META-INF/services/java.awt.Toolkit</code> with one line
<code>org.myorg.MyToolkit</code> into the JAR file that contains the
<code>MyToolkit</CODE> implementation. The code in <code>getDefaultToolkit</CODE>
will scan all JAR files in classpath and search for that file,
create an instance of <code>MyToolkit</code> and use it. 
The deployer can influence which toolkit will be created by 
adding the right JAR files into the classpath.
<P>
Of course the code to access the <code>META-INF/services/</code> files is even
more error prone than the <em>property pattern</EM>.  And this is exactly the
place where the <em>lookup library</em> can help. It provides an implementation of
the search algorithm with an easy interface. Just write:
<pre>
    <font class="keyword">import</font> <font class="type">java.awt.Toolkit</font>;
    <font class="keyword">import</font> <font class="type">org.openide.util.Lookup;</font>;
    <font class="type">Toolkit</font> <font class="variable-name">t</font> = (<font class="type">Toolkit</font>)Lookup.getDefault().<a href="@TOP@org/openide/util/Lookup.html#lookup-java.lang.Class-">lookup</a>(Toolkit.<font class="keyword">class</font>);
</PRE>
and if the JAR with <code>MyToolkit</CODE> is in the class path, the simple call 
above will do the rest.
<P>
So whenever one writes an application divided into several independent modules (jar files)
that are being developed and deployed independently, there is a need for registering
and discovering components. First of all, a set of interfaces can be defined to enable 
inter-module communication (like the abstract class <code>java.awt.Toolkit</CODE>).
After that a set of modules providing implementation can written (<code>MyToolkit</code> and other concurent implementations)
and after that, whenever a module trying to utilitize the functionality wants to access
the <code>Toolkit</code> via lookup, the real implementation is returned.
<P>
It is the responsibility of lookup to find a suitable implementation of the
requested service and return an object implementing the service. This is the
the basic functionality and while the library provides you with a little bit
more, even this simple usage might be extremaly useful: the client code knows
nothing about the implementation and the implementation can be switched in
deployment time by simply replacing one implementation jar with other. There
is no code change required.

<H2> Local lookup usage </H2>
The example in previous paragraph demostrated the usage of lookup as a global
registry (by using the <CODE>Lookup.getDefault()</CODE> call). One can also
consider another scenario where the lookup can help.
<P>
Let's switch hats to be an API designer for a while. The goal is to introduce a
new object into the system. But you either are not sure yet what all the roles
of the new object will be or you (more importantly) want to be able to add (or
change) roles of the object dynamically. So why not to introduce following
method to the object's interface:
<pre>
<font class="keyword">public class </FONT> <font class="type">MorphingObject</FONT> {
    <font class="keyword">public</FONT> <font class="type"><a href="@TOP@org/openide/util/Lookup.html">Lookup</A></FONT> getLookup() {
        <font class="keyword">return</FONT> <font class="variable-name">myLookup;</FONT>
    }
    ...
}
</pre>
By exposing the method getLookup you can attach different functionality to the
MorphingObject at runtime and whoever gets a reference to your object can ask it
whether the object supports a given interface like this:
<pre>
<font class="type">MorphingObject</FONT> <font class="variable-name">morph</FONT> = ...
<font class="type">AnInterface</font> <font class="variable-name">impl</font> = (<font
class="type">AnInterface</font>)morph.getLookup().<a
href="@TOP@org/openide/util/Lookup.html#lookup-java.lang.Class-">lookup</a>(AnInterface.<font class="keyword">class</font>);
<font class="keyword">if</font> (impl == <font class="constant">null</font>) {
    <font class="keyword">return;</font><font class="comment">/* AnInterface not supported now! */</font>
}
impl.useIt();
</PRE>

<H2>Additional functionality</H2>
The NetBeans lookup library also provides:
<UL>
<LI>Support for dynamically changing the lookup content.</LI>
<LI>The ability to return multiple results.</LI>
<LI>Notification of changes. After retrieving the result, the client can attach a
listener and be notified when the result of the lookup is changed.</LI>
<LI>Lazy initialization of the implementation. The implementation objects are
initialized only after someone asks for them. Even the implementation classes
are not loaded if they are not going to be used! </LI>
</UL>
