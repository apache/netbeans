<!--- 
  A file (resource) represents the MIME resolver input.
  The resource is tested on attributes obtained from lower layers (OS) such
  as extension, header bytes and wrapping <code>FileObject</code> attributes.
  Some of them must match to proceed to the <code>resolver</code> element.
  <p>
  Implementation Note: 
  Lower level MIME type is obtained by <code>FileUtil.getMIMEType()</code>. It may not be 
  retrieved by a call to <code>FileObject.getMIMEType</code> to avoid recursion. A better way
  to determine MIME type as assigned by the OS may be introduced in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
  Implementation Note: 
  All other tests are performed by calling appropriate methods on <code>FileObject</code>
  so there is a danger of recursion if these call <code>this.getMIMEType()</code>.

  Look at initial bytes of the file and test for a complete match of masked
  bits. The default mask is the hexadecimal byte <samp>FF</samp> repeated as
  many times as the <code>hex</code> attribute is long.
  E.g. <samp>&lt;magic hex="0a0001" mask="FF00FF"/&gt;</samp>

  Test on <code>FileObject</code> attributes. Matching attributes are converted
  to strings via <code>Object.toString()</code> and compared to the <code>text</code>
  attribute.
  <p>
  <code>FileObject</code> attributes can be used for out-of-band tagging of standard documents.
