            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number

            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used

            public packages

            making it too easy for other people to misuse your implementation
            details, that is why you should have good reason for not 
            restricting package access.
