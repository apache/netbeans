  </head>

<body>
<p>Task List is a window that shows problems or tasks - error/warnings/todos etc - associated with
files and folder under selected scope. The scope is either currently edited file, main project
or all opened projects.</p>

<p>The tasks are produced by task scanners. There are two types of scanners:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/tasklist/FileTaskScanner.html"/>FileTaskScanner</a> - creates tasks when polled by the Task List framework.</li>
        <li><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/tasklist/PushTaskScanner.html"/>PushTaskScanner</a> - can push new tasks into the Task List framework whenever necessary. It should be
            used when the tasks are calculated asynchronously or when the computation of tasks may be too long.</li>
    </ul>
