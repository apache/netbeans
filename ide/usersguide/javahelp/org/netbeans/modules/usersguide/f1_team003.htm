<h1>New Team Project Wizard: Summary</h1>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>The New Team Project wizard enables you to create a project on a registered Team Server. You open the wizard by choosing Team Server &gt; New Team Project from the Team menu. You can share the sources of an open project by right-clicking the project in the Projects window and choosing Share on Team Server in the popup menu.</p>
<p>The Summary page of the wizard enables you to view a summary of the services that will be set up when you click Finish. Depending on the options you selected in the wizard, the Summary page displays the following details about the Team project.</p>
<ul>
<li>the name and location of the project that will be created on Team Server</li>
<li>the location of the local repository</li>
<li>the location of the remote repository</li>
<li>the projects and/or files that will be committed to the remote repository</li>
<li>if an issue tracker for the project will be set up</li>
<li>if a chat room for the project will be created</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b>: If any of the details are incorrect, use the Back button to change the wizard options.</p>
<p>After you click Finish, the IDE will create the project on the Team Server and add the project to the list of My Project in the Team Dashboard. If you selected Commit sources in the wizard, the project sources are committed to the remote repository.</p>
<p>After the project is created, the sources can be downloaded freely by anyone. However, only approved members of the project team can commit changes to the repository and participate in the project's chat room.</p>
