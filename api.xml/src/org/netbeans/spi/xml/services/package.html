NetBeans XML tools services implementation guidelines.

<h2>XML Tools Services SPIs</h2>

<h3>Services and Settings</h3>
A service should not fully control its settings. The setting should be separated
(possibly standartized) and located by the service using run-time invocation
context. Context sensitive services must express their contextuality in API
allowing clients to pass the invocation context to them.

<h4>Global Service API Example</h4>
<pre>
public interface XMLService extends EntityResolver {
  // inherited from EntityResolver
  // InputSource resolveEntity(String publicId, String systemId);
}
</pre>

<h4>Context Sensitive Service API Example</h4>
<pre>
public interface CtxXMLService {
  InputSource resolveEntity(Lookup ctx, String publicId, String systemId);
}
</pre>
Also factoring approach can be used:
<pre>
public interface CtxService {
  XMLServiceWith30Methods getXMLService(Lookup ctx);
}
</pre>

<h3>Statefull Contextual Services</h3>
Some contextual services are statefull. In such case implementor must properly
handle state per individual context. For example such service can store its
state in context if apply.

<h3>Global Context</h3>
How should we handle <code>null</code> contexts? 
Treat them as global (for settings).
