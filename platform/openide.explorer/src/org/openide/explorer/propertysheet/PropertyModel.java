/**
 * A model defining the behavior of a property.  This model is used to allow
 * components such as PropertyPanel to be used with arbitrary JavaBeans, without
 * requiring them to be instances of Node.Property.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b>While not yet deprecated, this class will soon be deprecated.  The
 * only functionality it offers that is distinct from Node.Property and/or
 * PropertySupport.Reflection is the ability to listen to the model for
 * changes, rather than listening to the bean it is a property of.
 * <p>
 * Users of PropertyPanel are encouraged instead to use
 * its Node.Property constructor unless you are absolutely sure that
 * the property you want to display can be changed by circumstances
 * beyond your control <strong>while it is on screen</strong> (this is
 * usually a bug not a feature).
