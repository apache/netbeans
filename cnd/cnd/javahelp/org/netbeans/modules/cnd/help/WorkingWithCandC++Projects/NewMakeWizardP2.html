<h2>New C/C++ Project With Existing Sources Wizard: Build Actions</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>The New C/C++ Project With Existing Sources wizard enables you to create a project using an existing makefile.</p>
<p>In the Build Actions page, the wizard automatically fills in
the following fields for you:
<ul>
<li><b>Working Directory.</b> Specifies the directory where you want the IDE to
execute the <tt>make</tt> and <tt>clean</tt> commands.
</li>
<li><b>Clean Command.</b> Specifies the <tt>make clean</tt> command for the project.
</li>
<li><b>Build Command.</b> Specifies the <tt>make</tt> command for the project.
</li>
<li><b>Clean and Build after Finish.</b> Select this option to run
    the project's clean and build actions immediately after creating the project.
    Deselect this option if the source folder contains non-source files such as
    built binaries that you want to keep. You can clean and build manually after you
    move the files.
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can specify:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Build Log.</b> Specifies the path to the logged output generated by the existing makefile or configuration script.
<p>You can specify an existing build log that the IDE can use to
    gather code assistance information.</p></li>
</ul>
