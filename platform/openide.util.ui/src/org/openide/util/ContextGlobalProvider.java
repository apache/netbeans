/** An interface that can be registered in a lookup by subsystems
 * wish to provide a global context actions should react to. The global
 * context is accessible via {@link Utilities#actionsGlobalContext} method
 * and is expected to contain similar content as the context used when
 * context aware actions (see {@link ContextAwareAction}) are being
 * manipulated for example via method {@link Utilities#actionsToPopup}, so
 * in current state it is reasonable to put there all currently active
 * <a href="@org-openide-nodes@/org/openide/nodes/Node.html">Node</a>, their cookies and {@link javax.swing.ActionMap}.
 * By default this interface is implemented by window system to delegate
 * to currently activated <a href="@org-openide-windows@/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html#getLookup--">TopComponent's  lookup</a>.

 * There is an external FAQ entry describing how to
 * <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/wiki/DevFaqAddGlobalContext">add content to
 * the global context</a> by providing customized implementation of this
 * interface.
