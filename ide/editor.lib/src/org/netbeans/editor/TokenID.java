* Token-id is a unique identifier of a particular token.

* the appropriate token-context for which they are being
* created.
* The fact that <code>TokenID</code> extends <code>TokenCategory</code>
* helps to treat the colorings more easily by working with
* <code>TokenCategory</code> only (it can be <code>TokenID</code> too).
