       Create Test Wizard: Select Elements
    </h2>
    <p>
       The CppUnit Test wizard lets you create a CppUnit Test for the functions of your project.
      Before you can create CppUnit tests, you must install the CppUnit test framework, which is
      available from:
    </p>
    <p>
       ﻿
    </p>
    <p>
       <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/">
        <param name="text" value=
        "<html><u>http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/</u></html>">
        <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
        <param name="textColor" value="blue">
      </object>﻿
    </p>
    <p>
       If you have not installed CppUnit, click Cancel.
    </p>
    <p>
       If you have installed CppUnit, the Select Elements page lets you choose any or all of the
      functions of the selected source file. The functions you select will have preliminary test
      structure created for them by the wizard.
    </p>
    <p>
       Click the checkbox of the top node to select all the functions. If you do not want to test
      all functions, deselect the top node and select the individual functions that you want to
      test.
    </p>
    <p>
       Click Next when you have selected the functions you want.
