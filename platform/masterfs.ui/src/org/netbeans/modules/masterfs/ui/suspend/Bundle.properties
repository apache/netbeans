OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Sometimes one needs to perform extensive changes to one's sources from a command line (or other external tool) and wants to prevent the IDE from reacting to them. \
    This module provides "Suspend I/O" action into a Performance toolbar. \
    Once pressed, the IDE switches into "pause" mode. \
    Processing of external changes is delayed (until the IDE is resumed).
