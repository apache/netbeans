<BODY>
Creates an empty entity Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) component. An entity
bean is typically used to represent persistent objects. This template
creates the Java classes for a single entity bean and registers the
bean in the EJB module's deployment descriptor. You can use bean-managed persistence
(your code manages the persistence logic) or container-managed persistence (the
container manages the object to relational mapping). This template does not allow
mapping from an existing database.
