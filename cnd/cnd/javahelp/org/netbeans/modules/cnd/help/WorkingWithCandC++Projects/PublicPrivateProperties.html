       Using Properties Files for Version Controlled Projects
    </h2>

    </p>
    <p>The IDE supports two project properties files that are used for setting
        values for properties that you might want to share with developers on a
        version controlled project, but also provide a way for developers to override the shared
        properties values.</p>
    <p>The properties files are:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><tt>nbproject/project.properties</tt>
        </dt>
        <dd>The public properties file is shared in the version control system by default.</dd>
        <dt><tt>nbproject/private/private.properties</tt>
        </dt>
        <dd>The private properties file is not shared in the version control system by default,
        and any values set in it override the values of the same properties that are set in the
        <tt>nbproject/project.properties</tt> file.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>You can edit these files though the Files window when the project is open.  If you want
        to set a property and the file does not exist, simply create an empty file with the
        appropriate name.</p>
    <p>See <a href="../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/CodeAssistanceCache.html">Relocating Code Assistance
            Cache For Version Controlled Projects</a>
        for an example use for the properties file. </p>
