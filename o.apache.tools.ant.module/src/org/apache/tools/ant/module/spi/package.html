Ways of influencing how Ant is run inside NetBeans.

<p>{@link org.apache.tools.ant.module.spi.AutomaticExtraClasspathProvider} will be useful to modules which bundle
libraries that may be needed for some optional tasks shipped with Ant.</p>

<p>{@link org.apache.tools.ant.module.spi.AntLogger}, together with the auxiliary interfaces {@link org.apache.tools.ant.module.spi.AntSession},
{@link org.apache.tools.ant.module.spi.AntEvent}, and {@link org.apache.tools.ant.module.spi.TaskStructure}, provides a powerful way of controlling
the appearance of Ant process output.</p>

<h2><a name="register-defs">Registering Tasks and Types</a></h2>

<p>The Ant module provides a way for other modules to register custom Ant
tasks and types that will automatically be available to any scripts running
inside NetBeans.</p>

<ol>

<li><p><em>Do</em> consider this facility for tasks which would only make sense
running inside the NetBeans VM, typically making direct Java method calls to
internal NetBeans objects.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Do not</em> consider this facility for tasks which would be useful
in any context. You may bundle up such task JARs in <samp>ant/extra/*.jar</samp>
in the NetBeans distribution and recommend users use them via
<samp>&lt;taskdef&gt;</samp> with a <samp>&lt;classpath&gt;</samp>, as they would
any other third-party task libraries.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>Examples of likely tasks: opening the GUI-configured web browser on a URL,
reloading a NetBeans test module, attaching the NetBeans debugger to a running
application, etc. You could consider these things IDE scripting using Ant.</p>

<p>Registration is simple.
(Assume for sake of illustration that the code name base of the host module is
<samp>org.netbeans.modules.foo</samp>; in the following text, replace this package
sequence with the actual code name base of your module, using whatever separator
character is indicated.)
Create a JAR file containing the task class(es), named
<samp>org-netbeans-modules-foo.jar</samp>.
Create an entry in that JAR <samp>org/netbeans/modules/foo/antlib.xml</samp>
listing tasks (or types, macrodefs, etc.) you wish to define, in the
<a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTypes/antlib.html">standard Antlib format</a>.
For example:</p>

<pre>
&lt;?<span class="keyword">xml</span> <span class="variable-name">version</span>=<span class="string">"1.0"</span> <span class="variable-name">encoding</span>=<span class="string">"UTF-8"</span>?&gt;
&lt;<span class="function-name">antlib</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">taskdef</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"mytask1"</span> <span class="variable-name">classname</span>=<span class="string">"org.netbeans.modules.foo.MyTask1"</span>/&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">taskdef</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"mytask2"</span> <span class="variable-name">classname</span>=<span class="string">"org.netbeans.modules.foo.MyTask2"</span>/&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">antlib</span>&gt;
</pre>

<p>(Note that when using Ant 1.5, only <code>&lt;taskdef&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;typedef&gt;</code> elements are supported, and only
using the <code>name</code> and <code>classname</code>
attributes.)</p>

<p>Place the JAR file in the <samp>ant/nblib/</samp> directory of the NetBeans
distribution, i.e. bundle it in your NBM as
<samp>netbeans/ant/nblib/org-netbeans-modules-foo.jar</samp>. NetBeans will
automatically load your task/type definitions and make them available to build
scripts.</p>

<p>The task classes will be loaded in a special class loader, not the one
usually used for your module's classes. This loader will have access to:</p>

<ol>

<li>The JRE and JDK libraries.</li>

<li>The installed copy of Ant, including any user-configured Ant classpath.</li>

<li>Your module, including any extension JARs and anything your module
can directly refer to, such as other modules it depends on.</li>

</ol>

<p>Do <em>not</em> include copies of your task or type definitions in the module
JAR. They must reside only in <samp>ant/nblib/*.jar</samp>.</p>

<p>Now whenever your module is enabled, Ant projects run inside
NetBeans will have access to the definitions you provided. When running
Ant 1.5, the definitions will be
available with no namespace qualification, e.g.:</p>

<pre>
&lt;<span class="function-name">project</span> <span class="variable-name">default</span>=<span class="string">"all"</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">target</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"all"</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span class="function-name">mytask1</span> <span class="variable-name">arg</span>=<span class="string">"val"</span>/&gt;
    &lt;/<span class="function-name">target</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">project</span>&gt;
</pre>

<p>When running Ant 1.6, the definitions will still be available with no namespace
qualification. However it is recommended in 1.6 to namespace-qualify everything; so
the antlib is loaded in the namespace you would expect, ensuring that
there is no possibility of name clashes with unrelated tasks:</p>

<pre>
&lt;<span class="function-name">project</span> <span class="variable-name">default</span>=<span class="string">"all"</span>
         <span class="variable-name">xmlns</span>=<span class="string">"antlib:org.apache.tools.ant"</span>
         <span class="variable-name">xmlns:foo</span>=<span class="string">"antlib:org.netbeans.modules.foo"</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">target</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"all"</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span class="function-name">foo:mytask1</span> <span class="variable-name">arg</span>=<span class="string">"val"</span>/&gt;
    &lt;/<span class="function-name">target</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">project</span>&gt;
</pre>
