   The schema model provides a read and write schema model based on XDM and XAM. 
   </p>
   <api name="schema.model" category="friend" type="export" group="java">
       This package provides API's for obtaining a schema model using the
       factory pattern as well as reading and writing the schema structure. 
       This package is made up mostly of interfaces, which are not expected
       to be implemented by the client. The entry point is the schema
       model factory. The components are based on the structure of XML schema
       and the names should reflect element and attribute names from the 
       schema specification.

   <api name="schema.model.visitor" category="friend" type="export" group="java">
       Generic visitor pattern support (such as empty and deep visitors) as well
       as visitors for schema refactoring.

        </question>
-->
 <answer id="arch-quality">
  <p>
   Junit tests are provided and expected to cover the common functionality. The
   implementation is based on XDM and XAM and thus the implementations of the
   classes mostly perform parameterized manipulation of the underlying XDM model. 
   Thus the testing approach is to have extensive unit testing for 
   areas where custom code needs to be written (such as resolving references and sync)
   and course grained (does schema x work appropriately) for the balance of the
   features. 

   As part of the development process we also use findBugs for static analysis.

 <answer id="arch-usecases">
  <p>
   The typical client of the Schema model would be a tool author requiring read
or write access to XML Schema. 
  </p>
 
  <usecase id="uc1" name="WSDL model">
      The WSDL model uses the Schema model as part of the types extensibility
      element. The Schema model can thus be embedded in the WSDL model. 
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="uc2" name="Schema editor">
     The schema editor uses the schema model to support both textual and 
     graphical editing. 
  </usecase>
  <usecase id="uc3" name="BPEL assignment editor">
      The BPEL assignment editor provides the ability to assign documents to 
      variable using a copy statement. The copy statement mapping requires the
      structure of the incoming and outgoing documents to be visible to support
      visual transformation. The schema model is used to derive this information.
  </usecase>
  
  Here is a code sample for working with the Schema model:
  <code><br/><br/>
      FileObject schemaFileObj = ...; // get file object for Schema
      <br/><br/>
      ModelSource source = 
      <br/>
         org.netbeans.modules.xml.xam.locator.api.Utilities.getModelSource( 
	<br/>
            schemaFileObj, true);
      <br/>
      SchemaModel model = SchemaModelFactory.getDefault().getModel(source);
      <br/>
      // access global elements
      <br/>
      Collection&lt;P> globalElements = model.getSchema().getGlobalElements();
      <br/>
      <br/>
      // create new global element
      <br/>
      GlobalElement globalElement = model.getFactory().createGlobalElement();
      <br/>
      globalElement.setName("newGlobalElement");
      <br/>
      // manipulation before adding to model, name, etc. 
      <br/>
      try {
      <br/>
         // model must be manipulated in transaction
	 <br/>
         model.startTransaction();
	 <br/>
	 // add port type to model
	 <br/>
	 model.getSchema().addGlobalElement(globalElement);
	 <br/>
      } finally {
         <br/>

            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to

            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to?
            <hint>
                If your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
                Also describe when any events are fired: synchronously, asynchronously, etc.
