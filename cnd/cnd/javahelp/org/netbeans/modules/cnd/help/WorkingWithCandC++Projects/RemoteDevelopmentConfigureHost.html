       You can configure a remote build host to use for building, running, and debugging your C,
      C++, and Fortran projects. The remote host must meet the following conditions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The remote host operating system must be Oracle Solaris or Linux.
      </li>
      <li>
        The remote host must run the Secure Shell (SSH) daemon, <tt>sshd</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        At least one tool collection (GNU, Oracle Developer Studio) must be accessible
        on the remote host
      </li>
      <li>
        You must have a user account on the host.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>To configure a remote host:</b>
