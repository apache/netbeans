    <p>Docker is an open source container engine which enables the creation,
      execution and management of lightweight application containers. Using Docker, you
      can run instances from published images, which are available in a public
      repository. You can also use Dockerfile, which is a file with special instructions, to 
      create new images.</p>
    <p>You can connect to the Docker daemon running on your machine or on a remote machine. It
      is possible to use the IDE to download images from Docker Hub, and build your own images. You can
      also run and manage Docker Containers.</p>
