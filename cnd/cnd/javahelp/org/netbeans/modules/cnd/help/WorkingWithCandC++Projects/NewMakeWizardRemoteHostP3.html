    <p>
      The Summary page lets you specify some settings to be used in
      the IDE for this project
    </p>
    <ul>
<li><b>Display Name</b>: Type the name you want to display for this host. By default, the display name is
      <i>username@hostname</i>, which indicates the user name you used to log in and the remote host name.
    </li>
<li><b>Default Tool Collection</b>: Select the tool collection that you want the IDE to use on the remote
      build host. The options in the list indicate the tool collections that the IDE was able to locate on the
      remote server. If you know that a set of tools should be available on the host, but it is not
      listed here, you might need to tell the IDE where to find it after you finish setting up the
      host. See <a href="../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/ConfiguringBuildTools.html">Configuring
      Build Tools</a>.
    </li>
<li>
       <b>Synchronization</b>: Select the type of file synchronization you want to use to make the
      project files accessible to the remote server. The options are Smart Secure Copy and
      File System Sharing (no synchronization). The default option is Smart Secure Copy, which
      uses SSH protocol to transfer the project files to your .netbeans directory on the remote host.
      If the local host
      and the remote host share access to the file system where the project files are located,
      you can select File System Sharing.
    </li>
</ul>
