Introduction:
	This is the implementation of simple standalone editor application.
It is based on the fact that NetBeans editors are pure swing editors.
Everything you need for this editor is editor-lib.jar archive from NetBeans
build (modules/editor-lib.jar) and a set of classes from this directory
and subdirectories.

How to compile/setup it/run it:
	Basically, you need only Editor.java located under the base subdir
and editor-lib.jar to compile it and make it working with other Swing
EditorKits. To use NetBeans' Java and HTML editor, you also need to
compile JavaKit and HTMLKit. At best, just compile the whole content
of base/org/netbeans/editor/example:

  cd base/org/netbeans/editor/example
  javac -classpath $NB_HOME/modules/editor-lib.jar *.java

and make jar of classes and resources subdirectory:

  cd ../../../..
  jar -cvf editor.jar org/netbeans/editor/example/*.class org/netbeans/editor/example/res

now you can edit a configuration file settings.properties and setup
the kits you'd like. The file is thoroughly commented so it should be clear
how to add another kit or remove/reconfigure existing.
	The only thing that is not documented is Java_Completion key.
It is the key the JavaKit looks for on initialization. It should be the name
of JavaCompletion database, e.g. "/home/user/NetBeans/system/ParserDB/jdk13".
You have to update it to point to your ParserDB database in order
to JC work for you. Currently only one database is supported.
	It is also possible to set this file up earlier and add it to the jar
above (to the root of the jar), but I preffer to have it out of jar.
Also note that there is also an enabled definition of Properties editor,
for this editor, you also needs the files from properties-addon
directory and the properties module ($NB_HOME/modules/properties.jar).
Unless you are going to include properties support, remove the string
",Properties" from the end of "InstalledEditor" line.
	Finally there is a run.sh script in the "base" directory.
It is simple and it should be easy to write a .bat file for OS without
a suitable shell.
	Now, to run it, just copy/link editor-lib.jar to base directory
and use ./run.sh
	To add the support for properties files, compile and jar the files
in properties-addon to base/properties-addon.jar and copy the file
modules/properties.jar from your NetBeans instalation directory to
"base" directory. Don't forget to leave the Properties definition
in settings.properties enabled.
	I've also made a very simple script, "make.sh", that should build
everything up and place the result to the ~/StandAlone directory. 

	You can add any other swing editor kit to the standalone editor
just by adding its .jar to classpath and filling its record
in settings.properties. You could try e.g. Swings HTML Kit by modifying
line Html_KitClass=javax.swing.text.html.HTMLEditorKit

Why such a piece of SW:
	This work was originally intended to help editors and particulary
NetBeans editors writers. From this point of view, its major strength
is in its ability to start very quickly (below 4 seconds), se when you
are debugging lexical analyzer for your language, this would greatly
reduce the turnaroud time for elementar changes.
	It turned out this would be usable to end users too, because
of its second major strength - memory footprint. It runs with memory
footprint of about 20MB on Linux, or 14MB on Windows, so it could be
*very* usable to people with limited RAM, even when the Java editor
keeps most of its features, particulary Java Completion.
