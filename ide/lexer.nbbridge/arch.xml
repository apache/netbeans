    The lexer/nbbridge module provides the implementation of the <code>org.netbeans.spi.lexer.LanguageProvider</code>
    interface that allows to register <code>org.netbeans.api.lexer.Language</code>s and maps of
    embedded languages in the MimeLookup. It's basically a bridge between the netbeans-independent
    lexer module and Netbeans (MimeLookup).
    <br/>
    The module does not provide any API at all and the SPI is reduced to extending
    MimeLookup and defining a special folder for registering embedded languages.

  <p><usecase name="Language for mime-type" id="lang-for-mime-type">
      Basic information the lexer module needs to function properly is an implementation
      of a language and its tokens. This information in form of <code>Language</code>
      is used for lexing a text input. The lexer API accepts <code>Language</code>
      either explicitely or it tries to determine it from a mime type of an input document.
      <br/>
      The lexer/nbbridge module provides the implementation of the <code>org.netbeans.spi.lexer.LanguageProvider</code>
      interface, which looks for <code>Language</code>s in MimeLookup.
      This allows other modules registering <code>Language</code>s of
      languages they implement into MimeLookup. Such a <code>Language</code>
      should be registered under a mime-type appropriate for files that are normally
      used for storing text (i.e. source code) in this language.
      <br/>
      Assuming that there is a language called 'Simple Plain Language' and files
      containing source text of this language have a mime-type of 'text/x-simple-plain'
      the <code>org.netbeans.api.lexer.Language</code> for this language
      could be implemented by the following class.
      <pre>
        public final class SimplePlainTokenId {
        
            ... // Token ids definition

            private  static final Language&lt;SimplePlainTokenId&gt; language = new LanguageHierarchy&lt;SimplePlainTokenId&gt;() {

                protected Collection&lt;SimplePlainTokenId&gt; createTokenIds() {
                    return EnumSet.allOf(SimplePlainTokenId.class);
                }

                public Lexer&lt;SimplePlainTokenId&gt; createLexer(LexerRestartInfo&lt;SimplePlainTokenId&gt; info) {
                    return new SimplePlainLexer(info);
                }

                public LanguageEmbedding embedding(
                Token&lt;SimplePlainTokenId&gt; token, boolean tokenComplete,
                LanguagePath languagePath, InputAttributes inputAttributes) {
                    return null; // No embedding
                }

                public String mimeType() {
                    return "text/x-simple-plain";
                }

            }.language();

            public static Language&lt;SimplePlainTokenId&gt; language() {
                return language;
            }

        }
      </pre>
      <br/>
      The <code>SimplePlainTokenId.language()</code> should be registered in MimeLookup under
      the 'text/x-simple-plain' mime type in order to make it available for the
      lexer module. This registration can be done using the following fragment
      of a module layer.
      <pre>
        &lt;filesystem&gt;
            &lt;folder name="Editors"&gt;
                &lt;folder name="text"&gt;
                    &lt;folder name="x-simple-plain"&gt;
                        &lt;file name="org-netbeans-modules-lexer-nbbridge-test-simple-SimplePlainTokenId.instance"&gt;
                            &lt;attr name="instanceCreate" methodvalue="org.netbeans.modules.lexer.nbbridge.test.simple.SimplePlainTokenId.language()"/&gt;
                            &lt;attr name="instanceOf" stringvalue="org.netbeans.api.lexer.Language"/&gt;
                        &lt;/file&gt;
                    &lt;/folder&gt;
                &lt;/folder&gt;
            &lt;/folder&gt;
        &lt;/filesystem&gt;
      </pre>
      This of course assumes that the <code>SimplePlainTokenId</code> class resides
      in the <code>org.netbeans.modules.lexer.nbbridge.test.simple</code> package.
  </usecase></p>
  
  <p><usecase name="Embedded Languages" id="embedded-lang">
      The reality of today's world is that some source files contain text in several
      different languages. As an example you can think of javadoc comments in
      a java source file, of java scriplets in a JSP file or of JavaScript in
      an HTML file. The lexer module covers language embedding by allowing tokens
      from one language to contain text in another language. Such a token can be
      further lexed using the embedded language and provide a new set of sub-tokens.
      Obviously, the language embedding is recursive and there is no limit on how
      many languages can be embedded or how deep the embedding hierarchy can go.
      <br/>
      The lexer API supports two ways of defining tokens that contain text in
      another language and specifying what language that is. First, an implementation
      of <code>org.netbeans.api.lexer.Language</code> can override
      the <code>embedding</code> method and return <code>Language</code>
      of an embedded language for each token that contains text in an embeded language.
      This way puts the implementation of the hosting language in control of
      what tokens contain an embedded contents and what language this contnents
      represents.
      <br/>
      Another alternative is for an implementor of a language that could potentianly
      be embedded to some other language to extend a token from that language (hosting language)
      and specify that the token can be further broken to tokens from another
      language. The lexer/nbbridge module allows this to be done declaratively in MimeLookup.
      <br/>
      Assuming that there are two languages called 'Simple Plain Language' and
      'Simple Char Language' and that the Simple Char Language is embedded
      into the Simple Plain Language extending the Simple Plain Language's token
      WORD the registration can be achieved by the following fragment of a
      module layer.
      <pre>
        &lt;filesystem&gt;
            &lt;folder name="Editors"&gt;
                &lt;folder name="text"&gt;
                    &lt;folder name="x-simple-char"&gt;
                        &lt;file name="org-netbeans-modules-lexer-nbbridge-test-simple-SimpleCharLanguage.instance"&gt;
                            &lt;attr name="instanceCreate" methodvalue="org.netbeans.modules.lexer.nbbridge.test.simple.SimpleCharLanguage.description"/&gt;
                            &lt;attr name="instanceOf" stringvalue="org.netbeans.api.lexer.Language"/&gt;
                        &lt;/file&gt;
                    &lt;/folder&gt;
                    &lt;folder name="x-simple-plain"&gt;
                        &lt;file name="org-netbeans-modules-lexer-nbbridge-test-simple-SimplePlainLanguage.instance"&gt;
                            &lt;attr name="instanceCreate" methodvalue="org.netbeans.modules.lexer.nbbridge.test.simple.SimplePlainLanguage.description"/&gt;
                            &lt;attr name="instanceOf" stringvalue="org.netbeans.api.lexer.Language"/&gt;
                        &lt;/file&gt;
                        &lt;folder name="languagesEmbeddingMap"&gt;
                            &lt;file name="WORD"&gt;&lt;![CDATA[text/x-simple-char]]&gt;&lt;/file&gt;
                        &lt;/folder&gt;
                    &lt;/folder&gt;
                &lt;/folder&gt;
            &lt;/folder&gt;
        &lt;/filesystem&gt;
      </pre>
      Please note that the <code>Language</code> implementations of
      both languages are registered under their respective mime types (i.e.
      text/x-simple-plain and text/x-simple-char). The implementing classes are
      placed in the <code>org.netbeans.modules.lexer.nbbridge.test.simple</code>
      package.
      <br/>
      The interesting bit is the <code>languagesEmbeddingMap</code> folder and its
      files. This folder contains a map of languages that extend tokens from the
      Simple Plain Language (i.e. text/x-simple-plain). Each file's name is
      a name of a token from the Simple Plain Language, which contains text
      in an embedded language. The embedded language is determined by the contents
      of the file, which is a mime type of that language.
      <br/>
      Therefore this module layer fragment specifies that the WORD token from
      the Simple Plain Language contains text in an embedded language with the
      'text/x-simple-char' mime-type, where the Simple Char Language's implementation
      is registered.
  </usecase></p>

    of the <code>org.netbeans.spi.lexer.LanguageProvider</code>. The lexer/nbbridge

            If you allow foreign code to be plugged into your own module, how
            do you enforce that it will behave correctly and quickly and will not
            negatively influence the performance of your own module?

            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the preferred
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.

        <question id="resources-layer" when="final">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create any files or
            folders in it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            components?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

        </question>

 <answer id="resources-layer">
  <p>
    No, but it expects other modules to register their lexer services in MimeLookup.
    Specifically, modules can register embedded languages under the <code>languagesEmbeddingMap</code>
    subfolder of particular mime-paths.

        <question id="resources-mask" when="final">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resources provided by other modules in

            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.

            Also note that your API implementation
