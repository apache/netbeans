       Environment Dialog Box
    </h2>
    <p>
       The Environment dialog box lets you set runtime environment variables for your C or C++
      Application or Library project. To open the dialog box, right-click the project name in the
      Project window, and select Properties. Select the Run node, and click the browse button next
      to Environment. The dialog box is a table of empty Name and Value columns which are not
      editable at first.

        type the variable name. Select the Value text field and type the value.
      </li>
      <li>
        To remove an environment variable, select the variable and click Remove.
