<a href="http://top/org/openide/loaders/doc-files/api.html"><em>Datasystems</em></a>

are the logical layer between a filesystem and higher-level file-oriented operations.

<p>The

<a href="doc-files/api.html"><b>Datasystems API</b></a>

provides a higher-level view of files in terms of useful data - data
which has specific types, actions that can be performed on these
types, and relationships to other files. For example, NetBeans might
find these files in a newly-opened directory:

<ul>
<li> <code>myform.form</code>
<li> <code>myform.java</code>
<li> <code>myform.class</code>
<li> <code>myform$1.class</code>
<li> <code>myform$2.class</code>
</ul>

Logically, all of these files are interlinked, and it is the job of a

<a href="DataLoader.html"><em>data loader</em></a>

to associate them. In this case, a loader installed by the Form Editor
into the system's

<a href="DataLoaderPool.html"><em>loader pool</em></a>

would recognize the common basename of the files, and produce a
special

<a href="DataObject.html"><em>data object</em></a>

which encapsulates that there is a Java source with an accompanying
form and compiled class files. This data object would then provide
operations appropriate to a form on disk, and assist in creating an
Explorer node subtree for it.
