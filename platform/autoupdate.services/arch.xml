            AutoUpdate feature provides several services to IDE: <b>download and install</b> available updates of installed modules,
            <b>search and install</b> new features from subscribed Update Centers, <b>browsing and manipulating</b>
            the modules in IDE installation and handling of module <b>localizations</b>.
            To use the services have to AutoUpdate supply a GUI to easy manipulating. AutoUpdate feature has to care about
            registration Update Centers as well.
        </p>
        <p>Several several services means that Autoupdate feature contain several <b>parts of functionality</b>.
            These part of AutoUpdate should communicate each other. Moreover, some interface <b>should be public</b>.
            One of them is <b>SPI</b> (<code><api type="export" category="official" group="java" name="org.netbeans.spi.autoupdate" url="@TOP@/overview-summary.html"/></code>) for Update Center backend - allows to create and subscribe the Update Center in IDE.
            Next there should be a <b>API</b> (<code><api type="export" category="official" group="java" name="org.netbeans.api.autoupdate" url="@TOP@/overview-summary.html"/></code>) which communicate to rest of IDE and provide some services what is useful for
            NB installers, a non-visual client of Auto Update which make possible to use Auto Update from command line
            as standalone application in "admin" mode. All of them needs a APIs. This document describes proposed APIs,
            supposed use-cases and design of interaction Auto Update parts each other.

        </p>
        <b>Naming</b>: <i>What is feature?</i> Group of modules which are close connected together and cannot acts separately.
        I think that <b>feature</b> is common understand notation
        and fits its matter we will use it from now on.

    <question id="format-types" when="impl">
    Which protocols and file formats (if any) does your module read or write on disk,
    or transmit or receive over the network? Do you generate an ant build script?
    Can it be edited and modified?

    <hint>
    <p>
    Files can be read and written by other programs, modules and users. If they influence
    your behaviour, make sure you either document the format or claim that it is a private
    api (using the &lt;api&gt; tag).
    </p>

    <p>
    If you generate an ant build file, this is very likely going to be seen by end users and
    they will be attempted to edit it. You should be ready for that and provide here a link
    to documentation that you have for such purposes and also describe how you are going to
    understand such files during next release, when you (very likely) slightly change the
    format.

    NetBeans is build around a generic registry of services called
    lookup. It is preferable to use it for registration and discovery
    if possible. See

    Most of algorithms have increasing memory and speed complexity

    part of your project that can be seen as a bottleneck with
    respect to speed or required memory? What are the practical
    sizes of data you tested your project with? What is your estimate
    of potential size of data that would cause visible performance
    problems? Is there some kind of check to detect such situation
    and prevent "hard" crashes - for example the CloneableEditorSupport
    checks for size of a file to be opened in editor
    and if it is larger than 1Mb it shows a dialog giving the
    user the right to decide - e.g. to cancel or commit suicide.

    If you do a lot of tricks when adding actions to regular or context menus, you can significantly
    slow down display of the menu, even when the user is not using your action. Pay attention to
    actions you add to the main menu bar, and to context menus of foreign nodes or components. If
    the action is conditionally enabled, or changes its display dynamically, you need to check the
    impact on performance. In some cases it may be more appropriate to make a simple action that is
    always enabled but does more detailed checks in a dialog if it is actually run.
