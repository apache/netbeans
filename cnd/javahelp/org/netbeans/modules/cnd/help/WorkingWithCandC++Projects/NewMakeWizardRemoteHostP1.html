    <h2>
       New C/C++ Project With Remote Existing Sources Wizard: Select Remote Host
    </h2>
    <p>The Select Remote Host page lets you select the host where your existing source
files are located. You can select an existing build host or
       select a new remote host from hosts available on your network. A host is
considered available if it allows access by secure shell (ssh).
</P>
<ul>
<li><b>Existing Build Host.</b> If you have already defined build hosts
for your projects, they are listed here. If you select a host from the list, a login dialog box
unless you are already logged into that host. Login to the host and then click Next.
</li>
<li><b>New Build Host.</b> The table displays the hosts found and indicates
their availability.
    <ul>
<li>
       <b>Hostname</b>. Double-click the name of a host in the table to select it, or type the
      hostname you want to use in the Hostname field.
    </li>
    <li>
       <b>Port</b>. By default, ssh uses port 22. If the remote host uses a different port for ssh,
      you can type it here.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Click Next.</p>
