         Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) defines
         a set of complementary services that help improve the structure
         of application code. beans.xml is used to enable CDI services
         for the current bean archive as well as to enable named
         interceptors, decorators and alternatives for the current bean
         archive.

            Bean classes of enabled beans must be
            deployed in bean archives. A library jar, EJB jar,
            application client jar or rar archive is a bean archive if
            it has a file named beans.xml in the META-INF directory. The
            WEB-INF/classes directory of a war is a bean archive if
            there is a file named beans.xml in the WEB-INF directory of
            the war. A directory in the JVM classpath is a bean archive
            if it has a file named beans.xml in the META-INF directory.

   <xs:element name="interceptors">
      <xs:annotation>
         <xs:documentation>
            By default, a bean archive has no enabled
            interceptors bound via interceptor bindings. An interceptor
            must be explicitly enabled by listing its class under the
            &lt;interceptors&gt; element of the beans.xml file of the
            bean archive. The order of the interceptor declarations
            determines the interceptor ordering. Interceptors which
            occur earlier in the list are called first. If the same
            class is listed twice under the &lt;interceptors&gt;
            element, the container automatically detects the problem and
            treats it as a deployment problem.

                     Each child &lt;class&gt; element
                     must specify the name of an interceptor class. If
                     there is no class with the specified name, or if
                     the class with the specified name is not an
                     interceptor class, the container automatically
                     detects the problem and treats it as a deployment
                     problem.

   <xs:element name="decorators">
      <xs:annotation>
         <xs:documentation>
            By default, a bean archive has no enabled
            decorators. A decorator must be explicitly enabled by
            listing its bean class under the &lt;decorators&gt; element
            of the beans.xml file of the bean archive. The order of the
            decorator declarations determines the decorator ordering.
            Decorators which occur earlier in the list are called first.
            If the same class is listed twice under the
            &lt;decorators&gt; element, the container automatically
            detects the problem and treats it as a deployment problem.

   <xs:element name="alternatives">
      <xs:annotation>
         <xs:documentation>
            An alternative is a bean that must be
            explicitly declared in the beans.xml file if it should be
            available for lookup, injection or EL resolution. By
            default, a bean archive has no selected alternatives. An
            alternative must be explicitly declared using the
            &lt;alternatives&gt; element of the beans.xml file of the
            bean archive. The &lt;alternatives&gt; element contains a
            list of bean classes and stereotypes. An alternative is
            selected for the bean archive if either: the alternative is
            a managed bean or session bean and the bean class of the
            bean is listed, or the alternative is a producer method,
            field or resource, and the bean class that declares the
            method or field is listed, or any @Alternative stereotype of
            the alternative is listed.

                     the class with the specified name is not an
                     alternative bean class, the container automatically
