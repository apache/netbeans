<h2>C and C++ Call Stack Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>
The Call Stack window lists the sequence of function calls made during
execution of the current thread. By default, the Call Stack window
opens automatically whenever you start a debugging session.
You can open the Call Stack window by choosing Window &gt;
Debugging &gt; Call Stack.
</p>
<p>
If you open the Call Stack window when a debugging session is
running, it closes automatically when you end the debugging session.
If you open the window when no debugging session is running, the window
stays open until you close it.
</p>
<p>
By default, the window shows the name of the function for each call.
To display additional information, including the frame number,
optimization, program counter,
and the filename and line number of the function's currently
executing statement, click the
Change Visible Columns button
<img src="../images/visibleColumns.png" alt="Change Visible Columns button">&nbsp;
and select columns in the Change Visible Columns dialog box.
</p>
<p>
If you double-click the function, the editor
jumps to the function in your source code.
</p>
<p>
The initial function is at the
bottom of the Call Stack window. The function that was executing when the
program stopped is at the top of the window. This function is known
as the stopped-in function.
</p>
<p>One call is the current call. By default, this call is the most
recent call made by the current thread. When you select a different
current thread in the Threads window, the Call Stack window is updated
to show the calls
for that thread. The values of variables in the Variables
window are adjusted for the context of the current call.
</p>
<h3>Icons</h3>
<p>The following table describes the icons displayed to the left of the
call name.
