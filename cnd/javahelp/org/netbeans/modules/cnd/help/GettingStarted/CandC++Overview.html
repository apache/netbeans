       C/C++/Fortran Development Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp;</small>
    </p>
    <p>
       The following windows and tools are central to performing your daily C, C++, or Fortran development
      tasks in the IDE:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="#Projects">Projects window</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#Files">Files window</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#Navigator">Navigator window</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#Classes">Classes window</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#Editor">Source Editor window</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#Compilers">Compilers</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
       Projects Window<a name="Projects"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="ProjectsWindow.html">Projects window</a> is the main entry point to your
      project sources. It shows a logical view of important project contents such as source files,
      header files, and makefiles. You can right-click any project node to access a contextual menu
      of commands for building and running, as well as to open the Project Properties dialog box.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Files Window<a name="Files"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="FilesWindow.html">Files window</a> shows a directory-based view of your
      projects, including files and folders that are not displayed in the Projects window. From the
      Files window, you can open and edit your project configuration files, like the project build
      script and properties file. You can also view build outputs like object (<tt>.o</tt>) files
      and executable (<tt>.exe</tt>) files.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Navigator Window<a name="Navigator"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The Navigator window is a tool that displays information about C or C++ or Fortran source files in the
      currently open project. By default, the Navigator window is located in the lower lefthand
      corner of the IDE's workspace below the Projects and Files windows.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Classes Window<a name="Classes"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The Classes window lets you see all of the classes in your C++ project, and the members and
      fields for each class. By default, the Classes window is located in the same section of the
      IDE's workspace as the Projects and Files windows.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Source Editor Window<a name="Editor"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The Source Editor is a full-featured text editor that is integrated with the Projects window
      and the compilers. The Source Editor is automatically opened when a new and editable object
      is created from the available templates in the IDE. It can also be opened by double-clicking
      the node of an editable object in the Projects window.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Compilers<a name="Compilers"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The Run menu contains commands for compiling applications. You can compile an entire project
      or compile single files. You can also access the most common compiling actions by using the
      command buttons in the Run toolbar or by using the keyboard equivalents.
    </p>
    <ul class="note"><li>
       The IDE does not include C/C++ compilers. Instead it uses compilers that it finds in your
      path. If you do not have compilers in your software environment, you must install them. For
      more information, see the C/C++ Learning Trail at<tt>http://www.netbeans.org/kb/trails/cnd.html</tt>.
