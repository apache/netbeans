<h2>Configure Code Assistance Wizard: Simple Configuration</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>For a C/C++ Project With Existing Sources, the Configure Code
Assistance wizard lets you specify how your code will be parsed by the
built-in parser used for the code assistance features of
the IDE.
</p>
<p>The Simple Configuration page is displayed if you selected Simple Mode
on the Select Mode page and your project has been built with debug information.
The Simple Configuration page lets you specify the configuration level at
which the options are set.
</p>
<b>Configuration Level.</b>
You can select from the following levels:
<ul>
<li><b>Configure Project Properties.</b> Options are set for
the entire project from a union of file configurations. This option
makes project maintenance simple.
</li>
<li><b>Configure Folder Properties.</b> Options are set for
each folder from a union of file configurations.
</li><li><b>Configure File Properties.</b> Options are set for
each file. This level creates the most precise configuration but makes
project maintenance more difficult.</li></ul>
