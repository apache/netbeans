<h2>Terminals for netbeans</h2>
<p>
This module provides terminal services inside netbeans.
It does so at several levels:
<ul>
    <li>
        Actions to start a terminal running a shell or a command of users choice
        in a default terminal TopComponent.
        <br>
        The actions are tentatively placed under the Run menu.
    </li>
    <li>
        API for creating a Terminal and running a Program under it.
        <br>
            See the class comment for {@link org.netbeans.modules.terminal.api.Terminal} for an example.
    </li>
    <li>
        API for constructing custom TopComponents for harboring Terminals.
        <br>
            See the class comment for {@link org.netbeans.modules.terminal.api.TerminalContainer} for an example
            of how to do this.
    </li>
    <li>
        An alternative implementation of NetBeans's standard {@link org.openide.windows.IOProvider} API.
        <br>
            See the class comment for {@link org.netbeans.modules.terminal.ioprovider.TerminalIOProvider} for an example
            of how to aquire such a service.
        <br>
            See the class comment for {@link org.netbeans.modules.terminal.ioprovider.TerminalInputOutput} for a
            discussion of how to take extra advantage of the underlying
            {@link org.netbeans.lib.terminalemulator.Term}.
    </li>
</ul>
