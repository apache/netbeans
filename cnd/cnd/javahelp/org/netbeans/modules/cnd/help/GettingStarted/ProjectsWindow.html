       Projects Window
    </h2>
    <p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp;</small>
    </p>
    <p>
       The Projects window is the main entry point to your projects. It shows a logical view of
      important project contents. You can open the Projects window by choosing Window &gt; Projects
      (Ctrl-1).
    </p>
    <p>
       You can view all of your project contents in a directory-based view in the <a href=
      "FilesWindow.html">Files window</a>. To open the Files window, choose Window &gt; Files
      (Ctrl-2).
    </p>
    <h3>
       Logical Folders
    </h3>
    <p>
       A C or C++ Application or Library project is created with four logical folders, which are
      displayed in the Projects window:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Source Files
      </li>
      <li>
        Header Files
      </li>
      <li>
        Resource Files
      </li>
      <li>
          Test Files
      </li>
      <li>
        Important Files
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       A C or C++ Project from Existing Sources is created with one logical folder, Important
      Files.
    </p>
    <p>
       A logical folder is not a directory. It is a way for you to organize your files, and does
      not reflect where the files are physically stored. Files added to the Source Files folder,
      Header Files folder, and other logical folders become part of a project and are
      compiled when you build the project. Note that header files added to the Header Files folder
      must be referenced in your C/C++ source files through #include statements in the usual way if you want
      them to be compiled into the program.
    </p>
    <p>
       Files added to the Important Files folder are not part of the project and are not compiled
      when you build the project. These files are just for reference and are convenient for
      projects with existing makefiles.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Project Icons

    <p>
       The following icons are used for C and C++ projects in the Projects window.

    <h3>
       Main Project
    </h3>
    <p>
       By default the toolbar buttons apply to the project that is selected.  However, you can set one project to be the main project so that the toolbar buttons always apply to the main project, no matter which project is selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Projects window, if a main project has been set it is shown in bold.  You can set any project as the
      main project by choosing Run &gt; Set Main Project &gt; <i>projectname</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Pop-up Context Menu
    </h3>
    <p>
       Each node in the Projects window has a pop-up context menu of commands that you can run on
      that node. You open a node's pop-up menu by right-clicking the node. The pop-up menu for
      project nodes contains all of the major project commands, like Build and Run. The pop-up menu
      also contains a Properties command, which you can use to configure your project.
