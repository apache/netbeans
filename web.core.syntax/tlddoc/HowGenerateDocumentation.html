        <h2>How to generate documentation from tld</h2>

        This document describes step by step, how to generate documentation from tld and put this documentation in the build. It has only sense, when there are descriptions for tags and attributes in the tld file.

        <ul>
            <li>Download the <a href="https://taglibrarydoc.dev.java.net/">Tag Library Documentation Generator</a>.</li>
            <li>Generate the documentation. You have to use changed xslt files which are in the cvs repository. The changed xslt files include special anchors, which are used during displaying the help in java popup window in the IDE.
                <br><br>
                For example this is command, which I used for generating documentation for JSTL 1.1:<br>
                <table border='1' bgcolor='#aaaaaa'>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <code>
                                java -jar tlddoc.jar -d /space/tmp/jstl -xslt /space/cvs/tlddoc/xslt -doctitle "JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library 1.1 Tag Reference" -windowtitle "JSPL 1.1 - Generated Documentation" standard.jar
                            </code>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <blockquote>
                    <font size='-1'/>
                        The standard.jar for jstl 1.1.1 contains tld files, where is defined the same short name for two libraries. 
                        The tool can not generate documentation, when there are more libraries with the same short name. So you can change the short name in tld by hand.
                    </font>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>Create zip file from the generated files. The index.html file has to be in the root of the zip file.</li>

            <li>Put the zip file in the web/tlddoc/doc/ folder and commit in the cvs.</li>

            <li>Put copy task in the web/jspsyntax/build.xml. The zip file should be placed in the {$nbinstal}/ide/docs</li>

            <li>Edit method initHelp in the JspSyntaxSupport.java file. Put into the static helpMap appropriate items. </li>
        </ul>
