Prepare Bundles
===============

This is a tool that simplifies creation of external binaries from NPM modules. To use it,
create a directory "bundles" and inside it a directory "package", with package.json.
The package.json should specifying modules that should be packed (their transitive dependencies
will be pulled in automatically as well). Then run this project with two parameters: the location of the
"bundles" directory, and the location of the NetBeans checkout. This tool will produce the
following inside the "bundles" directory:
 * bundles directory, which should be suitable for copying into the "external" directory of
   your module. This directory includes licenses, binaries-list, and the zipped modules
 * external directory, which contains zips that should be uploaded to the binary storage server
 * licenses directory, which contains new license files that should be put into nbbuild/licenses

Run directly
------------

The binary can be run directly using the maven exec module. The call assumes,
that the path to the netbeans checkout is placed into the environment variable
$NB_CHECKOUT.

```
cd $NB_CHECKOUT
mvn -f webcommon/typescript.editor/bundles/prepare \
    -Dexec.mainClass="org.netbeans.modules.learning.prepare.PrepareBundles" \
    -Dexec.args="$NB_CHECKOUT/webcommon/typescript.editor/bundles $NB_CHECKOUT" \
    package exec:java
```
