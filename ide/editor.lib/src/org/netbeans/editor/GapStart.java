/**
 * A given object can publish this interface if it allows
 * an efficient access to its gap-based data storage
 * and wants to give its clients a hint about how to access
 * the data efficiently.
 * <P>For example {@link javax.swing.text.Document} instance
 * having gap-based document content can allow to get an instance
 * of GapStart as a property:<PRE>
 *      GapStart gs = (GapStart)doc.getProperty(GapStart.class);
 *      int gapStart = gs.getGapStart();
 * </PRE>
 * Once the start of the gap is known the client can optimize
 * access to the document's data. For example if the client
 * does not care about the chunks in which it gets the document's data
 * it can access the characters so that no character copying is done:<PRE>
 *      Segment text = new Segment();
 *      doc.getText(0, gapStart, text); // document's data below gap
 *      ...
 *      doc.getText(gapStart, doc.getLength(), text); // document's data over gap
 *      ...
 * </PRE>
 *
 * @author Miloslav Metelka
 * @version 1.00
 * @deprecated deprecated without replacement. Possibly use document's view as CharSequence
 *  by {@link org.netbeans.lib.editor.util.swing.DocumentUtilities#getText(javax.swing.text.Document)}.
