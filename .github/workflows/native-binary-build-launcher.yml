#  This workflow builds the native Windows launchers for the IDE and platform.
#
#  The result of the build are files 'launcher-external-sources.zip'
#  and 'launcher-external-binaries.zip' which can be downloaded from
#  the GitHub Actions UI and prepared for release to be used by the Ant build
#  scripts for the NetBeans distribution.
