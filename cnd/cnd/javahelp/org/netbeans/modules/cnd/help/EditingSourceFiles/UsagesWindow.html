<h2>Usages Window</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Usages window opens at the bottom of the IDE to display
the results of the Find Usages command. The window opens a separate
tab for each usages search. Each tab contains a tree view of the
file names and the lines of code for the usage found in that file.
By default, the physical view of the usage tree is displayed.
</p>
<p>The search results are displayed incrementally.
    The top line shows how many occurrences have been found and
how many are filtered out by your selections in the Find Usages
dialog box. You can click the Stop button on the left to discontinue
the search and keep the results already displayed in the window.</p>
<p>Double-click a usage line in the Usages window to go to the
corresponding line of code in the Source Editor.
</p>
<p>Buttons at the left side of the Usages window allow you to
change the display:
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="The left column lists
the button. The right column lists the description.">
