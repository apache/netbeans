    A single setting entry. Each setting is identified by its unique name and
    has a value attached to it.
    
    name:       (String) A unique identifier of this setting.
    
    value:      (Any) The setting's value. In general editor preferences can have
                values that are convertible to/from strings. The conversion methods
                are those provided for primitive types in java. More specifically,
                anything that can be get/set on java.util.prefs.Preferences can be
                stored here. For other values the modules are required to provide
                their own conversion to/from string and store the string value here.
                
                Please note, that only one from the 'value', 'valueId' attributes
                or 'value' child element can be used.
                
    valueId:    (String) A resource bundle key that will be used for reading the
                value for this setting. This is primarily designed for modules
                that use localized setting values. User changes will always be
                stored in the 'value' attribute or subelement.

    javaType:   (String) Fully qualified name of a java class representing this
                setting. This attribute is used purely for backwards compatibilty
                reasons. If you are sure that all your clients and your own
                code accesses this setting through MimeLookup and
                java.util.prefs.Preferences then you don't need this.
                
    category:   (String) Determines the API stability of the setting. It can
                be one of 'module' (the same as the API stability of a module declaring
                this setting), 'private', 'deprecated'.
                This attribute is ignored when loading settings, but should be
                provided to indicate the availability of the setting for other
                modules. If not specified or its value is not one of those listed
                above the setting should be considered 'private'. Only modules that
                'own' the setting should specify this attribute, if you are just supplying
                value for a setting defined (owned) by somebody else do not specify this attribute. 

    remove:     When 'true' this entry will be removed and all its
                optional attributes and elements will be ignored.
