       Configure Code Assistance Wizard: Configure Code Assistance
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
       For a C/C++ Project With Existing Sources, the Configure Code Assistance wizard lets you
      specify how your code will be parsed by the built-in parser used for the code assistance
      features of the IDE.
    </p>
    <p>
       The Configure Code Assistance page lets you specify the folder that contains the source
      files for your project and how it should be explored to determine the parsing options.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Source files root folder.</b> Lets you specify the folder that contains the source files
        for your project.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Select analyzer.</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Explore Build Log File.</b> Explore the log file produced when you build the project.
            Often the build log contains enough information for the IDE to determine the necessary
            options and the exact list of files to be built. To use the log as an information
            source, save your build log in a file and specify this file location in the next step.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Explore Exec Log File.</b> Explore the system library exec calls collected by build analyzer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Explore Executable or Library File.</b> Explore the debugging information in
            executables and library files.
          </li>
           <li>
            <b>Explore Object Files in Folder.</b> Explore debugging information in object files.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Search file system for C/C++ headers.</b> Gather information from the header files
            referenced in the project. Deprecated.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       The Explore Executable or Library File mode and the Explore Object Files in Folder mode
      require that the project has been built with debugging information. If you are using a Oracle
      Developer Studio compiler, building with the <tt>-g</tt> option is sufficient. If you are using
      a GNU compiler, use the following options:
