<!-- Question: compat-version

     <question id="compat-version">
            Does your module properly coexists with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read settings? Will future
            versions be able to read settings?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
    Only one version of the module can be installed at a time. 
    The settings are shared across different versions, stored
    and read by Java serialization and will be read in future as well.

            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used

<!-- Question: exec-classloader

     <question id="exec-classloader">
            Does your code uses own classloader?
            <hint>
            A bit unusual. Please explain why and what for.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="exec-classloader">
    Special classloader is used to load classes of user components in the form.
    <code>FormClassLoader</code> loads the classes either:
    <ul>
    <li>from user project classpath the form belongs to (default),</li>
    <li>from the system classloader (module),</li>
    <li>from both (allowing component class loaded from module to access resources
    in user project).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For loading from the user project classpath, special classloader is used
    <code>(ProjectClassLoader)</code> which uses execution classpath of the project
    to load classes, but the source classpath for resources (preferentially)
    so it is possible to access resources without the need to compile/build the project first.</p>
    <p>For loading a class using the second or third style, the class name must
    be registered via layer as described in <a href="#layer-ClassLoadingTypes">ClassLoadingTypes</a>.</p>

<!-- Question: exec-component

     <question id="exec-component">
            Is execution of your code influenced by (string) property
            of any of your components?
            
            <hint>
            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an
            API as well.
            </hint>

<answer id="exec-component">
    No.

<!-- Question: exec-introspection

     <question id="exec-introspection">
            Does your module use any kind of runtime type informations (instanceof,
            work with java.lang.Class, etc.)?
            <hint>
            Check for cases when you have an object of type A and you also
            expect it to (possibly) be of type B and do some special action. That
            should be documented. The same applies on operations in meta-level
            (Class.isInstance(...), Class.isAssignableFrom(...), etc.).
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="exec-introspection">
    Form editor uses runtime introspection heavily. It is mainly required by the fact
    that form editor manages complex meta data structures (representing components) that
    must be presented via limited JavaBeans infrastructure and properties support in the IDE.
    The cases when an object is tested on various types are quite common, but not documented.

            If there is a property that can change the behaviour of your 
            code, somebody will likely use it. You should describe what it does 
            and the stability category of this API. You may use

<!-- Question: perf-progress

     <question id="perf-progress">
            Does your module executes some long running task?
            <hint>Typically they are tasks like connecting over
            network, computing huge amount of data, compilation.
            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example
            using <code>RequestProcessor</code>), definitively it should 
            not block AWT thread.
            </hint>

<!-- Question: perf-scale

     <question id="perf-scale">
            Which external criteria influence the performance of your
            program (size of file in editor, number of files in menu, 
            in source directory, etc.) and how well your code scales?
            Please include some estimates.
        </question>

<answer id="perf-scale">
    Size of the .form data file and number of components influence
    opening time and editing responsiveness. Roughly, 100 components add
    5 sec to open time and 1 sec to edit/update time.

<!-- Question: resources-file

     <question id="resources-file">
            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.
            </hint>

<answer id="resources-file">
    Yes, but only for external JAR files when installing beans from them.

<!-- Question: resources-layer

     <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create some files or
            folders on it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            component?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.). 
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="resources-layer">
    Yes, files are created for menus, actions, shortcuts, templates, window system layout,
    settings storage, AbsoluteLayout.jar automount - these are all in standard Open
    APIs. For its own purpose, form editor uses the layer to define:
  <ul>
     <li>content of component palette,</li>
     <li>list of component classes that need to be loaded from IDE internally
         (from module, i.e. not from user projects as by default).</li>

<!-- Question: resources-mask

     <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resource provided by another one in
            module layer? 
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

    Form editor loads component classes from user project classpath by default. If some

    registered in a file placed under <code>org-netbeans-modules-form/classloader/system</code>
    folder (or <code>system_with_project</code> if the class needs to be able to
    access resources also on the project classpath). The file should be a plain text file listing

        <question id="exec-threading" when="impl">
            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to?
            <hint>
                If your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
                Also describe when any events are fired: synchronously, asynchronously, etc.
