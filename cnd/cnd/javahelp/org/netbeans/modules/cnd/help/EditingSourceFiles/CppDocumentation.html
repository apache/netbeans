       Using the C/C++ Documentation Window
    </h2>
    <p>
       You can use the C/C++ Documentation window to view documentation such as man pages for the
      function or method at the cursor.
    </p>
    <p>
       Choose Window &gt; IDE&nbsp;Tools &gt; C/C++&nbsp;Documentation to open the window.
    </p>
    <p>
       You must be connected to the build host that is configured for the project so the IDE can
