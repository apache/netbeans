<h2>New C/C++ Project With Existing Sources Wizard: Source Files</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>The New C/C++ Project With Existing Sources wizard enables you to create a project using an existing makefile.</p>
<p>In the Source Files page, you select the folders that contain the source files
associated with your project. The page automatically lists the folder that contains
the existing makefile.
</p>
<p><b>To add a source folder to your project:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Click Add Folder to open the Select Source File Folder dialog
box.</li>
<li>Select a folder to add and click Select.
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>To remove a source folder from your project:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Select the folder and click Remove.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Exclude Pattern.</b> Specifies any folders in the source directory
that you do not want the IDE to use for source files. Type POSIX-style regular
expressions to specify the files you want the IDE to ignore. The IDE provides
the default pattern <tt>^(nbproject)$</tt> to exclude files
in the project folders. You can add other folders to this pattern, for example
use ^(nbproject|build|test|tests)$ to ignore files in build, test, and tests.</p>

<p>You can also add the folders to the project using the Add Folders button.</p>
