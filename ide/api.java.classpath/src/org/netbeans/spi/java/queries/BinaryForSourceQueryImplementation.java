     * repeated calling of this method with the same recognized root the method has to
     * return the same instance of BinaryForSourceQuery.Result.<br>
     * The typical implemantation of the findBinaryRoots contains 3 steps:

     * <li>Check if the sourceRoot is recognized, if not return null</li>

     * and return it.</li>
