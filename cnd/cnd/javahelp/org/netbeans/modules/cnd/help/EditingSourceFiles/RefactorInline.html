<h2>Refactoring Inline</h2>
<p>With inline refactoring, you can replace macros with actual values.
    This is useful if a macro is only used one time in a project, for example.</p>

<table summary="Descriptions of Inline refactoring options." border="1" width="100%" frame="hsides" rules="groups" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<col width="24%" />
<col width="*" />
<thead>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<th align="left" valign="bottom">Element</th>
<th align="left" valign="bottom">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td align="left">
<p>In place</p>
</td>
<td align="left">Applies changes only to the selected location.</td>
</tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td align="left">
<p>In file</p>
</td>
<td align="left">Applies changes to item's occurrences in the current file.</td>
