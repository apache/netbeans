        <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
        <p>
            GSF makes unit testing your specific features easy.
            By extending the <code>GsfTestBase</code> unit test class
            (which in turn extends <code>NbTestCase</code> which in turn
            extends JUnit's <code>TestCase</code>), you inherit a number
            of additional unit testing methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, you have to write a few configuration steps
            for your language, once - this is described at the end of
            this document in the <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a> section.
        </p>
        <h3>Unit Test Workflow</h3>
        <p>
            All GSF unit tests are based on "golden files".
            <ul>
                <li>You have a source file in your language.</li>
                <li>The source file is parsed and then your language feature
                is run on the given parse result</li>
                <li> The result from your feature is pretty printed</li>
                <li> The pretty-printed output is compared to a previously
                    saved golden file result. If there is a difference, the test fails.
                </li>
                <li>Crucially, the FIRST time you run the test, there is no golden file,
                    so one is created instead!  This makes it trivial to create new
                    tests. Just add more test files, manually check that your feature
                    is producing the correct result for these test files, and then
                    run them as unit tests. You now have golden files which ensure
                    that for these testcases you get the same feature output every time.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Example: Semantic Highlighting</h3>
        <p>
            To illustrate how this works, I'll use an example. To create 
            a semantic highlighting unit test, create a new test method like this
            in your SemanticHighlighterTest:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
    public void testSemantic1() throws Exception {
        checkSemantic("testfiles/test1.js");
    }
            </pre>
            Here, the <code>checkSemantic</code> method is inherited for you from
            <code>GsfTestBase</code>, and handles testing semantic highlighting code
            by parsing your testfile (which is specified by a path relative to your
            <code>test/unit/data/</code> directory in your plugin), then hands it
            to your semantic highlighter, and then prints and diffs the output. 
            The <code>checkSemantic</code> method will pretty print your source
            file by inserting markers for the logical attributes you've added superimposed
            on top of the code.
            For example, here is <code>test1.js</code>, a simple JavaScript file:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
    Draggable.prototype = {
      scroll: function() {
        var wind, window2, y = 1, win3 = 50;
        var windo
        if(this.scroll == window) {
        }
      }
    }
            </pre>
            When I run the above test the first time, it fails, along with this error 
            message: "<code>Please re-run the test</code>".
            If you now run the test again, it will pass, and will continue to pass
            until you the output of your semantic highlighter changes for this input.
            If we look in the unit test directory, there is a new file right next
            to the testfile with the extra extension <code>.semantic</code>: 
            <code>test1.js.semantic</code>.
            Here's how that file looks:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
    |&gt;CLASS:Draggable&lt;|.prototype = {
      |&gt;METHOD:scroll&lt;|: function() {
        var |&gt;UNUSED:wind&lt;|, |&gt;UNUSED:window2&lt;|, |&gt;UNUSED:y&lt;| = 1, |&gt;UNUSED:win3&lt;| = 50;
        var |&gt;UNUSED:windo&lt;|
        if(this.scroll == |&gt;GLOBAL:window&lt;|) {
        }
      }
    }
            </pre>
            
            Notice how this is identical to the input file, but with |&gt;MARKERS:&lt;| inserted around
            sections of code that indicate what kind of highlighting attribute is associated with
            that span.  It should be trivial to look at this golden file and convince yourself
            that the semantic highlighting worked correctly here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Repeat this process for all the different scenarios you want to test your semantic
            highlighter for.
        </p>
        <p>
            Occasionally, you get a unit test failure. Perhaps you've accidentally
            broken your code - or perhaps you've actually fixed a bug, which changes the
            output of your semantic highlighter in some way, so your golden file diff
            fails and the test files. There is a textual diff printed to the output when
            you run the test in the IDE, but personally I find it hard to read.
            Your tests, and your golden files, should all be checked in with your code,
            and therefore version controlled. So what I do in this scenario is just
            remove all the golden files (<code>rm *.semantic</code> for example),
            and run the tests again. I then use the builtin IDE diff tool to diff
            all the golden files and see what the changes are. Sometimes, the changes
            are an improvement, and I want the goldenfile updated (which it now has been!)
            to reflect the new behavior. And in some cases, the change is a bad one,
            and I have a regression on my hands, so I revert the file change,
            and start debugging to track down the problem.
            Here's an example of diffing golden files, where in this case there is
            definitely a problem - the highlighter is no longer identifying regular
            expressions in JavaScript (which has to be done at the parse level rather
            than at the lexical level in JavaScript):
            <br/>
            <img src="test-diff.png" />
            <br/>
            <br/>
        </p>
        <h3>Caret-based Tests</h3>
        <p>
            Many GSF features are associated with a caret position. For example,
            code completion applies at a particular offset, and ditto for
            mark occurrences.
        </p>
        <p>
            The convention in GSF is to tell unit tests about a caret position
            by passing in a substring of the testfile, with an extra <code>^</code>
            (arrow up) indicating the caret position. For example, in the
            above semantic highlighting code fragment, if I wanted to identify
            a caret position between the "f" and the "u" of the function keyword
            on the second line, I could pass in this string:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
    "scroll: f<b>^</b>unction"
            </pre>
            Note that this isn't a complete line of the source - it can be just a
            portion of a line. The key part is that it tells GSF where the caret
            offset should be in the file, without having to tell it something
            awkward like an integer offset. Unit tests will assert if you're
            passing in a caret offset and it cannot find the corresponding position
            in the source file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's an example of a unit test which uses this:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
    checkOccurrences("testfiles/semantic4.js", "function myfunc(param1, pa^ram2) {", true);
            </pre>            
            This is the test for the Mark Occurrences feature. We're telling it
            which source file we want to test, <b>and</b> where the caret is. <b>Your</b>
            occurrences marker will be asked to compute the occurrences corresponding
            to the given offset. If we run this test, it will compute all the occurrences
            and pretty print them by listing ONLY the lines in the file that contain
            an occurrence, and showing that occurrence in context (e.g. the source
            code with the region containing the marker). Here's the occurrences output
            for another test file:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
    Spry.Effect.Registry.prototype.getRegisteredEffect = function(|&gt;MARK_OCCURRENCES:elem^ent&lt;|, effect)
            var eleIdx = this.getIndexOfElement(|&gt;MARK_OCCURRENCES:element&lt;|);
                    var addedElement = new Spry.Effect.AnimatedElement(|&gt;MARK_OCCURRENCES:element&lt;|);
            </pre>            
            
        </p>
        <h3>Code Completion Tests</h3>
        <p>
            Here's an example of a code completion test. Again, we point to some test
            file, as well as a caret position - in this case, it's at the beginning
            of the symbol "escape", so there's no prefix:
            
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
    public void testExpression1() throws Exception {
        checkCompletion("testfiles/completion/lib/expressions.js", "^escape", false);
    }
            </pre>            
            This will generate (and then diff as usual) the following code completion output:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
Results for escape with queryType=COMPLETION and nameKind=PREFIX
METHOD     exec(str) : void                           RegExp
METHOD     test(str) : Boolean                        RegExp
METHOD     toSource() : void                          RegExp
METHOD     toString() : String                        RegExp
METHOD     watch(prop, handler) : void                RegExp
PROPERTY   constructor                                RegExp
PROPERTY   global : Boolean                           RegExp
PROPERTY   ignoreCase : Boolean                       RegExp
PROPERTY   lastIndex : Number                         RegExp
PROPERTY   multiline                                  RegExp
PROPERTY   prototype                                  RegExp
PROPERTY   source : String                            RegExp
------------------------------------                  
METHOD     eval(string) : void                        Object
METHOD     hasOwnProperty(prop) : Boolean             Object
METHOD     isPrototypeOf(object) : Boolea             Object
METHOD     propertyIsEnumerable(prop) : B             Object
METHOD     toLocaleString() : String                  Object
            </pre>
            The divider line here is showing the difference between the smart
            items and the non-smart items (just like the dividing line you see
            in the IDE).
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, writing code completion tests is pretty trivial. 
        </p>
        <h3>Other Features</h3>
        <p>
            There are many other feature tests like this, and all are very
            similar to the above: a single line call with test data which
            gets pretty printed and diffed.  For example,
            the <b>insertChar</b> test (and removeChar and insertBreak etc) let
            you test what happens when you type keys in the editor. You provide
            the document contents and caret position before, the character to be
            typed, and the contents and caret position after the insert, like this:
            <pre>
    insertChar("x = ^", '\'', "x = '^'");                
            </pre>
            This test ensures that bracket matching works correctly for the apostrophy
            for example. You should obviously write lots of other tests for this to
            make sure that bracket matching doesn't happen inside strings and
            comments, when there is already a bracket there, etc:
            <pre>
    insertChar("x = '^'", '\'', "x = ''^");
    insertChar("// Hello^", '\'', "// Hello'^");
    <i>etc.</i>
            </pre>
            There are unit tests for all kinds of features. Formatting. Keystroke
            handling. Quickfixes. Instant Rename. Indexing. Code Folding. Navigation.
        </p>
        <h3>AST Offset Tests</h3>
        <p>
            Unlike the feature tests, the AST offset test support involves a bit
            more work. That's because GSF does not have any clue about
            <b>your</b> AST. GSF doesn't even know about it; you typically stash
            it in your own subclass of the <code>ParserResult</code> class.
            However, GSF makes it easier to make sure that your AST offsets
            are correct, which is typically vital for correct IDE operation.
            To test your own ASTs, you need to override a couple of protected
            methods in the GsfTestBase:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
    protected String <b>describeNode</b>(CompilationInfo info, Object node, boolean includePath);
    protected void <b>initializeNodes</b>(CompilationInfo info, List validNodes,
            Map&lt;Object,OffsetRange&gt; positions, List invalidNodes);
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            The first method just lets you create a description of the node
            (which will show up in the AST golden file). Typically there will be some
            AST specific way to identify node types - for example, STRING, EXPRESSION,
            FUNCTION, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
             In the second method, you need to go and pull ALL nodes out of the
             AST for your parser result, and put all of them into a map, where
             each node maps to a given OffsetRange (the start/end offsets) of your
             nodes that you are trying to test. You can ignore the other offsets
             for now. Once you do that, you can write tests like this:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
    public void testOffsets1() throws Exception {
        checkOffsets("testfiles/test1.js");
    }
            </pre>
            This is the <code>test1.js</code> file we saw for semantic highlighting above.
            Here the golden file will be named <code>test1.js.offsets</code> (as opposed
            to the <code>.semantic</code> golden file we get from the semantic test).
            The golden file will use XML-like syntax to show the node descriptions around
            the begin/end offsets for your nested AST hierarchy that corresponds to
            your source:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
&lt;SCRIPT&gt;&lt;EXPR_RESULT&gt;&lt;SETPROP&gt;&lt;NAME&gt;<b>Draggable</b>&lt;/NAME&gt;<b>.</b>&lt;STRING&gt;<b>prototype</b>&lt;/STRING&gt;<b> = </b>&lt;OBJECTLIT&gt;<b>{</b>
  &lt;OBJLITNAME&gt;<b>scroll</b>&lt;/OBJLITNAME&gt;<b>: </b>&lt;FUNCTION&gt;<b>function() </b>&lt;BLOCK&gt;<b>{</b> 
    &lt;VAR&gt;var &lt;NAME&gt;wind&lt;/NAME&gt;, &lt;NAME&gt;window2&lt;/NAME&gt;, &lt;NAME&gt;y = &lt;NUMBER&gt;1&lt;/NUMBER&gt;&lt;/NAME&gt;, &lt;NAME&gt;win3 = &lt;NUMBER&gt;50&lt;/NUMBER&gt;&lt;/NAME&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;;
    &lt;VAR&gt;var &lt;NAME&gt;windo&lt;/NAME&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;
    &lt;BLOCK&gt;if(&lt;IFNE&gt;&lt;EQ&gt;&lt;GETPROP&gt;&lt;THIS&gt;this&lt;/THIS&gt;.&lt;STRING&gt;scroll&lt;/STRING&gt;&lt;/GETPROP&gt; == &lt;NAME&gt;window&lt;/NAME&gt;&lt;/EQ&gt;&lt;/IFNE&gt;) &lt;BLOCK&gt;{
    }&lt;TARGET&gt;&lt;/TARGET&gt;&lt;/BLOCK&gt;&lt;/BLOCK&gt;  &lt;RETURN&gt;&lt;/RETURN&gt;&lt;/BLOCK&gt;}&lt;/FUNCTION&gt;
}&lt;/OBJECTLIT&gt;&lt;/SETPROP&gt;&lt;/EXPR_RESULT&gt;&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;   
            </pre>
            I've bolded the beginning of the embedded code here so you can see the code 
            through the AST node markup.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have made a lot of diffs to the Rhino parser for the JavaScript support to add in
            AST offset support (Rhino doesn't record source offsets, we've added that for NetBeans).
            Having tests like these makes it a lot easier to feel confident when I make any changes to the
            parser. As shown earlier, if there are diffs, I delete the offset files, run the tests, and
            then diff the golden files through the IDE.
        </p>

        <h3>Configuration</h3>
        <p>
            Typically, you'll want to create your own <code>TestBase</code> class,
            which extends <code>GsfTestBase</code>, and then make all your unit tests
            extend your own <code>TestBase</code>.  In your superclass, you need to
            do a few configuration steps.

                around with module dependencies, Mock services etc. but I haven't
