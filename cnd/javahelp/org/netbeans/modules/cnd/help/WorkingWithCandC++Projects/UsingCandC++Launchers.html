<title>Using C or C++ Project Launchers</title>

<h2>Using C or C++ Project Launchers</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>You can create launchers so you can easily run your project from the
    project context menu with different arguments, for example, or launch it from a script.
    Normally when you run your application from the IDE, the executable specified in
    the project properties as the Run command is executed. If you create launchers,
    you can specify multiple commands to run. Right-click the project
    and select Run As &gt; <i>launcher-name</i> to run them.
<p>You can use the same launchers for debugging by right-clicking the project
    and selecting Debug As &gt; <i>launcher-name</i>.</p>
<p><b>To create a launcher:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Open the project and go to the Files window (Ctrl-2).
</li>
<li>Open the folder <tt>nbproject/private</tt> and double-click the file
    <tt>launcher.properties</tt> to open it in the Source Editor.
</li>
<li>Edit the file to specify commands to run and display names to show in the IDE for running those commands.
See the comments in the <tt>launcher.properties</tt> file that explain the macros you can use with the launchers.</li>
<li>Save the file and go back to the Projects window.</li>
<li>Right-click the project and select Run As to run the project using the launchers you specified.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Launchers Example</h3>
<p>For the IDE's C/C++ sample application called Arguments, you could
    add the following to your <tt>launcher.properties</tt> file:</p>
<pre>
launcher1.runCommand="${OUTPUT_PATH}" "arg 1" "arg 2" "arg 3" "arg 4"
launcher1.displayName=Four Args

launcher2.runCommand=../dist/Debug/OracleSolarisStudio-Solaris-x86/arguments_1 "arg 1"
launcher2.displayName=One Arg

launcher3.runCommand=/bin/sh runMyProgram.sh
</pre>
<p>With this <tt>launcher.properties</tt> file, you would then be able to run the project using Run As &gt; Four Args and
Run As &gt; One Arg or Run As &gt; /bin/sh runMyProgram.sh.</p>
<p>
The file <tt>runMyProgram.sh</tt> might be a script that sets environment variables for example, or does anything you want.
</p>
<p>
If you want to debug your application using a launcher that runs a script, you must also specify
the option <tt>symbolFiles</tt> for that launcher so the debugger can debug the application
instead of the shell used to run the script. For the launcher3 example above, this option
could be added as follows:
</p>
<pre>
launcher3.runCommand=/bin/sh runMyProgram.sh
launcher3.symbolFiles=${LINKER_OUTPUT}
</pre>
