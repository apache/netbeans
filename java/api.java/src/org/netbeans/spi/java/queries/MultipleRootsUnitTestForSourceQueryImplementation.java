/**
 * Query to find Java package roots of unit tests for Java package root of
 * sources and vice versa.
 *
 * <p>A default implementation is registered by the
 * <code>org.netbeans.modules.java.project</code> module which looks up the
 * project corresponding to the binary file and checks whether that
 * project has an implementation of this interface in its lookup. If so, it
 * delegates to that implementation. Therefore it is not generally necessary
 * for a project type provider to register its own global implementation of
 * this query, if it depends on the Java Project module and uses this style.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface assumes following mapping pattern between source
 * files and unit tests: <code>*.java -> *Test.java</code>. This mapping
 * is used for example for unit test generation and for searching test for
 * source. Usage of any other pattern will break this functionality.</p>
 *
