/**
 * Factory used to create <a href="Children.html">Children</a>
 * objects.  Children objects supply child Nodes for a
 * Node.  Usage is to write a class that extends ChildFactory and
 * pass that to Children.create().  When the Node is expanded or its
 * children are programmatically requested, the
 * <a href="#createKeys(java.util.List)">createKeys(List &lt;T&gt;)</a> method
 * will be invoked to create the List of objects to be modelled as Nodes.
 * Later, on demand, each object from the List will be passed in turn to
 * <a href="#createNodesForKey(java.lang.Object)">createNodesForKey(T)</a>,
 * which may return an array of zero or more Nodes for the object.
 * <p>
 * A ChildFactory can be used either to create typical Children object, or
 * one which will be initialized on a background thread (providing
 * a "Please Wait" Node in the meantime).  It can be used most simple cases
 * that Children.Keys has been historically used for, and makes it easy to
 * change a Children object to compute its keys asynchronously if that is
 * needed for performance reasons.
 * <p>
 * Only one ChildFactory object may be used per Children object;  if you wish
 * to have multiple Nodes modelling children produced by a single
 * ChildFactory, use @link FilterNode to wrap the Node that owns the
 * Children object for this ChildFactory.
 * <p>
 * To use, simply override
 * <a href="#createKeys(java.util.List)">createKeys(List &lt;T&gt;) and
 * <a href="#createNodesForKey(java.lang.Object)">createNodesForKey(T)</a> or
 * <a href="#createNodeForKey(java.lang.Object)">createNodeForKey(T)</a>.
