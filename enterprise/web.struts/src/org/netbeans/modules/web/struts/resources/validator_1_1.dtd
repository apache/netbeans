<!--
     The "form-validation" element is the root of the configuration file
     hierarchy, and contains nested elements for all of the other
     configuration settings.

<!--
    The elements defined here are all global and must be nested within a
    "global" element.

     The "validator" element defines what validator objects can be used with
     the fields referenced by the formset elements.

     The "constant" element defines a static value that can be used as
     replacement parameters within "field" elements. The "constant-name" and

      localization is properly scoped, so that a formset can override just the
      language, or just the country, or both.

<!--
     The "field" element defines the properties to be validated. In a
     web application, a field would also correspond to a control on
     a HTML form. To validate the properties, the validator works through
     a JavaBean representation. The field element accepts these 
     attributes:

     property        The property on the JavaBean corresponding to this
                     field element.

     depends         The comma-delimited list of validators to apply against
                     this field. For the field to succeed, all the
                     validators must succeed.

     page            The JavaBean corresponding to this form may include
                     a page property. Only fields with a "page" attribute
                     value that is equal to or less than the page property
                     on the form JavaBean are processed. This is useful when
                     using a "wizard" approach to completing a large form,
                     to ensure that a page is not skipped.
                     [0]

     indexedListProperty
                     The "indexedListProperty" is the method name that will
                     return an array or a Collection used to retrieve the
                     list and then loop through the list performing the
                     validations for this field.

     The "msg" element defines a custom message key to use when one of the

     property that is used when a corresonding field msg is not specified.
