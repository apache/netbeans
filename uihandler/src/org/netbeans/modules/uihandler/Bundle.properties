In case the slowness appears repeatedly, you may <b>enable internal profiling</b> for further reports<br>\
by clicking Send Report and Enable Profiling. Profiling will be enabled for <b>this IDE run only</b> and<br>\
will be disabled again once the IDE is restarted. By providing profiling data, you significantly<br>\
enhance the chances the real problem is identified and solved. <p><p>\
Profiling is off by default, because it might slow the IDE operations. To enable it permanently,<br>\
add "-J-Dorg.netbeans.modules.parsing.impl.indexing.RepositoryUpdater.indexerSampling=enable"<br>\
option to the etc/netbeans.conf file in your IDE installation.
