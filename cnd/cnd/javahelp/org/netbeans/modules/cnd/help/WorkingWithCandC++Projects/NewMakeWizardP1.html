       New C/C++ Project With Existing Sources Wizard: Pre-Build Action
    </h2>

    </p>
    <p>
       The New C/C++ Project With Existing Sources wizard enables you to create a project using an
      existing makefile. When you select the Custom mode, you must make selections to determine how
      the project is configured.
    </p>
    <p>
       In the Pre-Build Action page, you can specify if you build your project using a custom
      command or script, a non-default configure script, cmake, or qmake.
    </p>
    <p>
       If you build your project with a makefile or configure script that already is present, click
      Next to continue to the Build Actions page.
    </p>
    <p>
       If you want to specify a different build process, select the checkbox <b>Pre-Build Step is
      Required</b> and make selections for the fields below.
    </p>
    <p>
       Note that if your project uses QMake or CMake, you must first install them separately
      because they are not included in the IDE.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Run in Folder.</b>Type or browse to the location of the working directory where the
        pre-build command must be run.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Custom Command.</b> If you are using a custom script to build, select this option and
        type the command that the IDE needs to run. Use the same command syntax and arguments you
        would use if running the command in a shell.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Predefined Command.</b> Select this option if you are using a non-default configure
        script, or cmake or qmake. Then select the type of script, and specify the script's
        location and arguments.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       The Preview panel shows the command that the IDE will run based on your input.
    </p>
    <p>
       <!--
      <ul>
      <li><b>Using an existing makefile.</b> If you build your project with an existing makefile, type the
      path to the makefile in the Existing Makefile text field, or click
      the Browse button and select the makefile in the Select Makefile
      dialog box.
      <p>The <b>Clean and Build after Finish</b> option causes the IDE to run
      the project's clean and build actions immediately after creating the project.
      Deselect this option if the source folder contains non-source files such as
      built binaries that you want to keep. You can clean and build manually after you
      move the files. You should also deselect to enable other options in the wizard.
      </li>
      <li><b>Using a makefile generated by a configure script.</b>
      If you build your project with a makefile generated by a configure
      script:
      <ol>
      <li>Select Using the makefile generated by the 'configure' script.</li>
      <li>Type the path to the configure script in the Configure
      Script text field, or click the Browse button and select the script in
      the Select Configure Script dialog box. The configure script will be
      included in the Important Files folder of your project, from which you can run it.</li>
      <li>Type the arguments for the configure script in the Configure
      Arguments text field.</li>
      <li>If you do not want your configure script run when you exit the
      wizard, deselect the Run 'configure' Script after Finish checkbox.
      </li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      </ul>-->
