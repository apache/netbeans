<H1>Tree package</H1>



<p>It represent parser tree as tree of beans. The beans should form the tree using BeanContext.
<p>The tree is produced by <tt>TreeBuilder</tt> that is basically a SAX handler.

<h2>Document and Declaration Nodes</h2>
Basically two kinds of nodes exist:
<ul>
<li>declaratin nodes <tt>*.Decl[.]java</tt>
<li>document nodes
</ul>
from any suitable document node can be obtained its declaration node by <tt>getDecl()</tt>.

<h3>Document Nodes</h3>
Element nodes can be classified as:
<ul>
<li>nodes that allows subelements <tt>boolean allowElements()</tt>
<li>nodes that allows text <tt>boolean allowText()</tt>
</ul>

<h2>Indentation</h2>
The tree nodes implement method <tt>toXMLString(bool, Map)</tt> that is used
while generating plain text from the tree. The second argument holds
formatting arguments or null for no formating is applied at all.
