# ${HOME} will be replaced by JVM user.home system property
netbeans_default_userdir="${HOME}/.netbeans/dev"

# Options used by NetBeans launcher by default, can be overridden by explicit
# command line switches:
netbeans_default_options="-J-Dnetbeans.keyring.no.master=true -J-client -J-Xverify:none -J-Xss2m -J-Xms32m -J-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true -J-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true"
#netbeans_default_options="-J-client -J-Xss2m -J-Xms32m -J-Xverify:none -J-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true"
# Note that a default -Xmx is selected for you automatically.
# You can find this value in var/log/messages.log file in your userdir.
# The automatically selected value can be overridden by specifying -J-Xmx here
# or on the command line.

# Default location of JDK, can be overridden by using --jdkhome <dir>:
#netbeans_jdkhome="C:\Sun\Java\jdk1.6.0_02"

# Additional module clusters, using ${path.separator} (';' on Windows or ':' on Unix):
#netbeans_extraclusters="/absolute/path/to/cluster1:/absolute/path/to/cluster2"
