/**
 * Allows to update the module declaration in projects which support JDK9. For modular projects,
 * it is not sufficient just to add artifacts on classpath - modular projects cannot access unnamed module,
 * so the project would not see such classes/resources during compilation. Even if added to the module path,
 * a directive needs to be added so that compiler and runtime honour the dependency.
 * <p>
 * This SPI allows the project implementation for modular project to diverge additions to a more suitable classpath,
 * and to update the module information.
 * <p>
 * Project-specific implementation should be placed in <b>project lookup</b>. If not present, default implementation
 * will handle the requests, so that artifacts, libraries and projects will land on {@link JavaClassPathConstants#MODULE_COMPILE_PATH}
 * or {@link JavaClassPathConstants#MODULE_EXECUTE_PATH} respectively. The default implementation does nothing for projects (sources), which do
 * not use {@code module-info} declaration, although they target JDK 9.
