    Each named pool definition results in a pool instantiated at server        
    start-up. Pool is populated when accessed for the first time. If two or    
    more jdbc-resource elements point to the same jdbc-connection-pool         
    element, they are using the same pool of connections, at run time.

        A pool with this property set to true, can be used by         
        non-J2EE components (i.e components other than EJBs or        
        Servlets). The returned connection is enlisted automatically  
        with the transaction context obtained from the transaction    
        manager. This property is to enable the pool to be used by    
        non-component callers such as ServletFilters, Lifecycle       
        modules, and 3rd party persistence managers. Standard J2EE    
        components can continue to use such pools. Connections        
        obtained by non-component callers are not automatically       
        cleaned at the end of a transaction by the container. They    
        need to be explicitly closed by the the caller.               
    associate-with-thread                                                      
        Associate a connection with the thread such that when the     
        same thread is in need of a connection, it can reuse the      
        connection already associated with that thread, thereby not   
        incurring the overhead of getting a connection from the pool. 
        Default value is false.                                       
    connection-creation-retry-attempts                                         
        The number of attempts to create a new connection. Default is 
        0, which implies no retries.                                  
    connection-creation-retry-interval-in-seconds                              
        The time interval between retries while attempting to create  
        a connection. Default is 10 seconds. Effective when           
        connection-creation-retry-attempts is greater than 0.         
    connection-leak-reclaim                                                    
        If enabled, connection will be reusable (put back into pool)  
        after connection-leak-timeout-in-seconds occurs. Default      
        value is false.                                               
    connection-leak-timeout-in-seconds                                         
        To aid user in detecting potential connection leaks by the    
        application. When a connection is not returned back to the    
        pool by the application within the specified period, it is    
        assumed to be a potential leak and stack trace of the caller  
        will be logged. Default is 0, which implies there is no leak  
        detection, by default. A positive non-zero value turns on     
        leak detection. Note however that, this attribute only        
        detects if there is a connection leak. The connection can be  
        reclaimed only if connection-leak-reclaim is set to true.     
    connection-validation-method                                               
        specifies the type of validation to be performed when         
        is-connection-validation-required is true. Default value of
	this attribute is table. (see validation-table-name). The following      
        types of validation are supported:                            
        auto-commit

        Name of the vendor supplied JDBC datasource resource manager. 
        An XA or global transactions capable datasource class will    
        implement javax.sql.XADatasource interface. Non XA or Local   
        transactions only datasources will implement                  
        javax.sql.Datasource interface.                               
    driver-classname
        Name of the vendor supplied JDBC driver class name. The 
        specified driver should implement the java.sql.Driver interface.	
    fail-all-connections                                                       
        indicates if all connections in the pool must be closed       
        should a single validation check fail. The default is false.  
        One attempt will be made to re-establish failed connections.  
    idle-timeout-in-seconds                                                    
        maximum time in seconds, that a connection can remain idle in 
        the pool. After this time, the pool implementation can close  
        this connection. Note that this does not control connection   
        timeouts enforced at the database server side. Adminsitrators 
        are advised to keep this timeout shorter than the database    
        server side timeout (if such timeouts are configured on the   
        specific vendor's database), to prevent accumulation of       
        unusable connection in Application Server.                    
    init-sql
        Used to specify a SQL string by the user, to be executed 
        whenever a connection is created from the pool (not the 
        connections that are reused). This is executed to initialize
        the state of the connection.
        This is an optional attribute and should carry a value when 
        a initialization SQL is to be executed.
    is-connection-validation-required                                          
        if true, connections are validated (checked to find out if    
        they are usable) before giving out to the application. The    
        default is false.                                             
    is-isolation-level-guaranteed                                              
        Applicable only when a particular isolation level is          
        specified for transaction-isolation-level. The default value  
        is true. This assures that every time a connection is         
        obtained from the pool, it is guaranteed to have the          
        isolation set to the desired value. This could have some      
        performance impact on some JDBC drivers. Can be set to false  
        by that administrator when they are certain that the          
        application does not change the isolation level before        
        returning the connection.                                     
    lazy-connection-association                                                
        Connections are lazily associated when an operation is        
        performed on them. Also, they are disassociated when the      
        transaction is completed and a component method ends, which   
        helps reuse of the physical connections. Default value is     
        false.                                                        
    lazy-connection-enlistment                                                 
        Enlist a resource to the transaction only when it is actually 
        used in a method, which avoids enlistment of connections that 
        are not used in a transaction. This also prevents unnecessary 
        enlistment of connections cached in the calling components.   
        Default value is false.                                       
    match-connections                                                          
        To switch on/off connection matching for the pool. It can be  
        set to false if the administrator knows that the connections  
        in the pool will always be homogeneous and hence a connection 
        picked from the pool need not be matched by the resource      
        adapter. Default value is false.                              
    max-connection-usage-count                                                 
        When specified, connections will be re-used by the pool for   
        the specified number of times after which it will be closed.  
        This is useful for instance, to avoid statement-leaks.        
        Default value is 0, which implies the feature is not enabled. 
    max-pool-size                                                              
        maximum number of conections that can be created              
    max-wait-time-in-millis                                                    
        amount of time the caller will wait before getting a          
        connection timeout. The default is 60 seconds. A value of 0   
        will force caller to wait indefinitely.                       
    name                                                                       
        unique name of the pool definition.                           
    non-transactional-connections                                              
        A pool with this property set to true returns                 
        non-transactional connections. This connection does not get   
        automatically enlisted with the transaction manager.          
    ping
        A pool with this attribute set to true is pinged during the pool
        creation or reconfiguration to identify and warn of any erroneous
        values for the its attributes. Default value of this attribute 
        is false.
    pool-resize-quantity                                                       
        number of connections to be removed when                      
        idle-timeout-in-seconds timer expires. Connections that have  
        idled for longer than the timeout are candidates for removal. 
        When the pool size reaches steady-pool-size, the connection   
        removal stops.                                                
    pooling
        When set to false, this attribute disables connection pooling. 
        Default value of this attribute is true.
    res-type                                                                   
        DataSource implementation class could implement one of of     
        javax.sql.DataSource, javax.sql.XADataSource or               
        javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource interfaces. To support 
        configuration of JDBC drivers and applications that use
        java.sql.Driver implementations, set this attribute to
        java.sql.Driver. This optional attribute must be specified to 
	disambiguate when a Datasource class implements two or more of 
	these interfaces or when a driver classname is to be provided. 
	An error is produced when this attribute has a legal value and the        
        indicated interface is not implemented by the datasource      
        class. This attribute has no default value. (see also driver-classname).
    sql-trace-listeners
        Used to set if the SQL statements executed by applications need to be traced, 
	enabling easy filtering of SQL statements executed as log messages. 
        Aids administrators in analysing the statements. Multiple listeners can be
        specified as comma separated list of listener implementation class names,
	to enable different means of recording the SQL trace records.
    statement-cache-size
        Specifies the number of statements to be cached. The only cache
	eviction strategy supported in this release is "Least Recently Used".
	The default value is 0 and statement caching is not enabled. Specify a
	non-zero integer value to enable statement caching.
    statement-timeout-in-seconds                                               
        Sets the timeout property of a connection to enable           
        termination of abnormally long running queries. Default value 
        of -1 implies that it is not enabled.                         
    statement-leak-reclaim
        If enabled, statement is reclaimed after the statement-leak-timeout-
        in-seconds occurs. Default value is false.
    statement-leak-timeout-in-seconds                                               
        To aid user in detecting the statement leaks by applications.
        When a statement is not closed by the application within the specified
        period, it is assumed to be a statement leak. Default is 0, which 
        implies there is no statement leak detection, by default. A 
        positive non-zero value turns on statement leak detection.
        Note however that, this attribute only detects if there is
        a statement leak. The statement can be reclaimed only is
        statement-leak-reclaim is set to true.     
    steady-pool-size                                                           
        minimum and initial number of connections maintained in the   
        pool.                                                         
    transaction-isolation-level                                                
        Specifies the Transaction Isolation Level on the pooled       
        database connections. Optional. Has no default. If left       
        unspecified the pool operates with default isolation level    
        provided by the JDBC Driver. A desired isolation level can be 
        set using one of the standard transaction isolation levels,   
        which see.                                                    

        Applications that change the Isolation level on a pooled connection    
        programmatically, risk polluting the pool and this could lead to       
        program errors. Also see: is-isolation-level-guaranteed                

    validate-atmost-once-period-in-seconds                                     
        Used to set the time-interval within which a connection is    
        validated atmost once. Default is 0 which implies that it is  
        not enabled. TBD: Documentation is to be corrected.           
    validation-classname
        Specifies the custom validation implementation class name to be used
	for validation. This parameter is mandatory if the 
	connection-validation-type is set to custom-validation. The specified
	class must implement the org.glassfish.api.jdbc.ConnectionValidation
	interface and must be accessible by the application server.
    validation-table-name                                                      
        specifies the table name to be used to perform a query to     
        validate a connection. This parameter is mandatory, if        
	is-connection-validation-required is set to true and 
	connection-validation-type set to table. Verification by      
        accessing a user specified table may become necessary for     
        connection validation, particularly if database driver caches 
        calls to setAutoCommit() and getMetaData().                   
    wrap-jdbc-objects                                                          
        When set to true, application will get wrapped jdbc objects   
        for Statement, PreparedStatement, CallableStatement,          
        ResultSet, DatabaseMetaData. Defaults to true.

<!-- connector-connection-pool
    connector-connection-pool defines configuration used to create    
    and manage a pool of connections to a EIS. Pool definition is     
    named, and can be referred to by multiple connector-resource      
    elements (See connector-resource).                                

    Each named pool definition results in a pool instantiated at server        
    start-up. Pool is populated when accessed for the first time. If two or    
    more connector-resource elements point to the same                         
    connector-connection-pool element, they are using the same pool of         
    connections, at run time.                                                  

    There can be more than one pool for one connection-definition in one       
    resource-adapter.                                                          


  children
    property                                                                   
        Properties are used to override the ManagedConnectionFactory  
        javabean configuration settings.                              

        When one or more of these properties are specified, they are passed as 
        is using set<Name>(<Value>) methods to the Resource Adapter's          
        ManagedConnectionfactory class (specified in ra.xml).                  


  attributes
    associate-with-thread                                                      
        Associate a connection with the thread such that when the     
        same thread is in need of a connection, it can reuse the      
        connection already associated with that thread, thereby not   
        incurring the overhead of getting a connection from the pool. 
        Default value is false.                                       
    connection-creation-retry-attempts                                         
        The number of attempts to create a new connection. Default is 
        0, which implies no retries.                                  
    connection-creation-retry-interval-in-seconds                              
        The time interval between retries while attempting to create  
        a connection. Default is 10 seconds. Effective when           
        connection-creation-retry-attempts is greater than 0.         
    connection-definition-name                                                 
        unique name, identifying one connection-definition in a       
        Resource Adapter. Currently this is ConnectionFactory type.   
    connection-leak-reclaim                                                    
        If enabled, connection will be reusable (put back into pool)  
        after connection-leak-timeout-in-seconds occurs. Default      
        value is false.                                               
    connection-leak-timeout-in-seconds                                         
        To aid user in detecting potential connection leaks by the    
        application. When a connection is not returned back to the    
        pool by the application within the specified period, it is    
        assumed to be a potential leak and stack trace of the caller  
        will be logged. Default is 0, which implies there is no leak  
        detection, by default. A positive non-zero value turns on     
        leak detection. Note however that, this attribute only        
        detects if there is a connection leak. The connection can be  
        reclaimed only if connection-leak-reclaim is set to true.     
    fail-all-connections                                                       
        indicates if all connections in the pool must be closed       
        should a single connection fail validation. The default is    
        false. One attempt will be made to re-establish failed        
        connections.                                                  
    idle-timeout-in-seconds                                                    
        maximum time in seconds, that a connection can remain idle in 
        the pool. After this time, the pool implementation can close  
        this connection. Note that this does not control connection   
        timeouts enforced at the database server side. Adminsitrators 
        are advised to keep this timeout shorter than the EIS         
        connection timeout (if such timeouts are configured on the    
        specific EIS), to prevent accumulation of unusable connection 
        in Application Server.                                        
    is-connection-validation-required                                          
        This attribute specifies if the connection that is about to   
        be returned is to be validated by the container,              
    lazy-connection-association                                                
        Connections are lazily associated when an operation is        
        performed on them. Also, they are disassociated when the      
        transaction is completed and a component method ends, which   
        helps reuse of the physical connections. Default value is     
        false.                                                        
    lazy-connection-enlistment                                                 
        Enlist a resource to the transaction only when it is actually 
        used in a method, which avoids enlistment of connections that 
        are not used in a transaction. This also prevents unnecessary 
        enlistment of connections cached in the calling components.   
        Default value is false.                                       
    match-connections                                                          
        To switch on/off connection matching for the pool. It can be  
        set to false if the administrator knows that the connections  
        in the pool will always be homogeneous and hence a connection 
        picked from the pool need not be matched by the resource      
        adapter. Default value is true.                               
    max-connection-usage-count                                                 
        When specified, connections will be re-used by the pool for   
        the specified number of times after which it will be closed.  
        This is useful for instance, to avoid statement-leaks.        
        Default value is 0, which implies the feature is not enabled. 
    max-pool-size                                                              
        maximum number of conections that can be created              
    max-wait-time-in-millis                                                    
        amount of time the caller will wait before getting a          
        connection timeout. The default is 60 seconds. A value of 0   
        will force caller to wait indefinitely.                       
    name                                                                       
        unique name of the pool definition.                           
    ping
        A pool with this attribute set to true is pinged during the pool
        creation or reconfiguration to identify and warn of any erroneous
        values for the its attributes. Default value of this attribute 
        is false.
    pool-resize-quantity                                                       
        number of connections to be removed when                      
        idle-timeout-in-seconds timer expires. Connections that have  
        idled for longer than the timeout are candidates for removal. 
        When the pool size reaches steady-pool-size, the connection   
        removal stops.                                                
    pooling
       When set to false, this attribute disables connection pooling.
       Default value of this attribute is true.	
    resource-adapter-name                                                      
        This is the name of resource adapter. Name of .rar file is    
        taken as the unique name for the resource adapter.            
    steady-pool-size                                                           
        minimum and initial number of connections maintained in the   
        pool.                                                         
    transaction-support                                                        
        Indicates the level of transaction support that this pool     
        will have. Possible values are "XATransaction",               
        "LocalTransaction" and "NoTransaction". This attribute will   
        override that transaction support attribute in the Resource   
        Adapter in a downward compatible way, i.e it can support a    
        lower/equal transaction level than specified in the RA, but   
        not a higher level.                                           
    validate-atmost-once-period-in-seconds                                     
        Used to set the time-interval within which a connection is    
        validated atmost once. Default is 0 which implies that it is  
        not enabled. TBD: Documentation is to be corrected.
