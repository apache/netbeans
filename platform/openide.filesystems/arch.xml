The Filesystems API provides a common API to access files in a uniform manner. 
It is available as standalone library and
also is bundled together with other parts of the openide.

            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions

<!-- Question: compat-version

     <question id="compat-version">
            Does your module properly coexists with earlier and future

            versions be able to read settings?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.

            Some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org">libraries</a>) and
            it is prefered to use this approach when more modules may

<!-- Question: resources-file

     <question id="resources-file">
            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?

            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.

Yes, naturally.

<!-- Question: resources-layer

     <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create some files or
            folders on it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            component?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

<!-- Question: resources-mask

     <question id="resources-mask">

            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

No.

                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.

                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
