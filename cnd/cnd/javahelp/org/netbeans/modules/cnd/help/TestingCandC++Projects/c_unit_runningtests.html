       Once you have created a test or test suite, you can use the Test command to initiate
      execution of the test. The Test command is available from the context menu of the project
      node, the Test Files node, and test suite nodes. After you run a test, you can choose to
      rerun individual tests that were executed during the test and displayed in the Test Results
      window.

       <b>To run all tests for a project:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select any node in the project in the Projects window.
      </li>
      <li>
        From the main menu, choose Run &gt; Test <i>project_name</i> (Alt-F6).
        <p>
           The IDE executes all of the project's tests.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        You can also right-click the project node or the project's Test Files folder and select
        Test from the popup menu to execute all the project's tests.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       <b>To run a single test suite:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Right-click the test suite subfolder under the Test Files node of project in the Projects
        window and select Test.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>To run a single test:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First, run the test suite containing the test.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Test Results window, right-click the test and choose Run Again.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ul class="note">
      <li>
        A test cannot be run by itself without first running the test suite.
