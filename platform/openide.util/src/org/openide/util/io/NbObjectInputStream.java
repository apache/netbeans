     * to new packages, renamed or changed (by a mistake) to not reflect the
     * version of class stored in previous sessions.
     * <P>
     * This method deals with some of this incompatibilites and provides the
     * module owners a way how to fix some of them.
     * <P>
     * When a class is read, the {@link org.openide.util.BaseUtilities#translate(String)} is consulted
     * to find out what whether the name of the class is listed there and
     * what new value is assigned to it. This allows complete rename of the
     * serialized class. For example:
     * <code>org.netbeans.core.NbMainExplorer</code>
     * can be renamed to
     * <code>org.netbeans.core.ui.NbExp</code> - of course supposing that
     * the new class is able to read the serialized fields of the old one.
     * <P>
     * Another useful feature of this method is the ability to supress wrong
     * <code>serialVersionUID</code>. This was causing us a lot of problems,
     * because people were forgetting to specify the <code>serialVersionUID</code>
     * field in their sources and then it was hard to recover from it. Right
     * now we have a solution: Just use {@link org.openide.util.BaseUtilities#translate(String)} framework
     * to assing your class <code>org.yourpackage.YourClass</code> the same
     * name as it had e.g. <code>org.yourpackage.YourClass</code>. This will
     * be interpreted by this method as a hit to suppress <code>serialVersionUID</code>
     * and the <code>NbObjectInputStream</code> will ignore its value.
     * <P>
     * Please see {@link org.openide.util.BaseUtilities#translate(String)} to learn how your module
     * can provide list of classes that changed name or want to suppress <code>serialVersionUID</code>.
