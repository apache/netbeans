Support for tree table view. The view is described via models - TreeModel,
TableModel and NodeModel. Filters can be applied to each model - TreeModelFilter,
TableModelFilter and NodeModelFilter. The view listens on changes in the models

<!-- Question: deploy-packages

            Are packages of your module made inaccessible by not declaring them
            public?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used
            whenever possible (<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/download/apis/org/openide/doc-files/upgrade.html#3.4-public-packages">

<!-- compatibility ********************************************************************** -->


<!-- Question: compat-i18n

     <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.

    Yes.

<!-- Question: compat-standards

     <question id="compat-standards">
            Does the module implements or defines any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or it deviates somehow?
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-standards">
    None defined or implemented.
</answer>



<!-- Question: compat-version

     <question id="compat-version">
            Does your module properly coexists with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read settings? Will future
            versions be able to read settings?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
    Only one version of the module can be installed at a time. 
    The settings are shared across different versions, stored
    and read by Java serialization and will be read in future as well.
</answer>




<!-- resources ********************************************************************** -->


<!-- Question: resources-file

     <question id="resources-file">
            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="resources-file">
    No.
</answer>



<!-- Question: resources-layer

     <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create some files or
            folders on it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            component?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.). 
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="resources-layer">
    No.
</answer>



<!-- Question: resources-mask

     <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resource provided by another one in
            module layer? 
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="resources-mask">
    No.
</answer>



<!-- Question: resources-read

     <question id="resources-read">
            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and clasify according to 
            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#categories">
            common stability categories</a>.

    No.

<!-- lookup ********************************************************************** -->


<!-- Question: lookup-lookup

     <question id="lookup-lookup">
            Does your module uses <code>org.openide.util.Lookup</code>
            to find any components to communicate to? Which ones?
            
            <hint>
            Please describe the interfaces you are searching for, where 
            are defined, whether you are searching for just one or more of them,
            if the order is important, etc. Also clasify the stability of such
            API contract.

<!-- Question: lookup-register

            Do you register anything into the lookup for other to find? 
            <hint>
            Do you register using layer file or using <code>META-INF/services</code>?
            Who is supposed to find your component?

            Are removing entries of other modules from the lookup? 
            <hint>
            Why? Of course, that is possible, but it can be dangerous. Is the module
            your are masking resource from aware of what you are doing?
            </hint>

     <question id="exec-property">
            Is execution of your code influenced by any environment of
            system (<code>System.getProperty</code>) property?
            
            <hint>
            If there is a property that can change the behaviour of your 
            code, somebody will likely use it. You should describe what it does 
            and the stability category of this API. You may use

            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an
            API as well.

            <hint>
            This usually indicates a missing or unsufficient API in the other
            part of the system. If the other side is not aware of your dependency

            Check for cases when you have an object of type A and you also
            expect it to (possibly) be of type B and do some special action. That
            should be documented. The same applies on operations in meta-level

<!-- Question: exec-threading
        <question id="exec-threading" when="impl">
            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to?
            <hint>
                If your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
                Also describe when any events are fired: synchronously, asynchronously, etc.
