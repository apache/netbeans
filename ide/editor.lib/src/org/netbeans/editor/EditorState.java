import java.util.HashMap;

/** This singleton class is an editor state encapsulation object. Every part
 * of the editor could store its state-holder here and it will be automatically
 * persistent across restarts. It is intended for any state informations
 * that are not "Settings", like the contents of the input field histories,
 * persistent, named bookmarks or so.
 * The implementation is just like a HashMap indexed by state-holders' names.
 * Typical usage is <CODE>myState = EditorState.get( MY_STATE_NAME );</CODE>
 * There is no support for state change notifications, but the inserted
 * value objects could be singletons as well and could do its own notifications.
 *
 * @author  Petr Nejedly
 * @version 1.0
 * @deprecated Use Editor Settings and Settings Storage APIs. Please note that
 *     the states stored here are not persisted and therefore don't survive
 *     JVM restarts.
