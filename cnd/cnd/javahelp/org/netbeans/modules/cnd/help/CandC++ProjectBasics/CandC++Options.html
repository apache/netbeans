       You can access this panel by choosing Tools &gt; Options and clicking the C/C++ category.
    </p>
    <p>
       The C/C++ panel of the Options window lets you configure build tools, project settings, code
      assistance settings, highlighting settings, and accepted file extensions for your C and C++
      projects. These options are used as default values for new C and C++ projects. Some of these
      settings can be overridden on individual projects by <a href=
      "../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/SettingCandC++ProjectProperties.html">setting project
      properties</a>.

    <p>
       <b>Build Host</b>. The list includes your local host and any remote hosts you have defined.
      You can add and remove remote build hosts, change the default host, and specify how to share
      project sources on the local host with the remote host. For information on using remote
      hosts, see <a href="../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/RemoteDevelopment.html">Remote
      Development</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To add a remote host, click Edit. In the Build Hosts Manager dialog box, click Add. The New
        Remote Host Setup wizard starts. See the help for the <a href=
        "../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/NewRemoteDevelopmentHostWizardP1.html">New Remote Host Setup
        wizard</a> for more information.
      </li>
      <li>
        To set a host as the default build host, click Edit. In the Build Hosts Manager dialog box,
        select the host, click Set as Default, then click OK. This host is used by default for new
        projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        To remove a remote host, click Edit. In the Build Hosts Manager dialog box, select the host
        you want to remove, click Remove, then click OK.
      </li>
      <li>
        To map shared project sources on the local host to a remote host, click Edit. In the Build
        Host Manager dialog box, click Path Mapper. In the Edit Path's Map dialog box, select the
        remote host in the Host list. For each mapping, in the Local Path field, type the path used
        to access the shared project sources from the local host. In the Remote Path field, type
        the path used to access the shared project sources from the remote host.
      </li>
      <li>
        To change IDE properties related to the remote build host, click Properties. In the Host
        Properties dialog box, you can change the name displayed in the IDE for the host by typing
        in the Display Name field. To change the way project files are shared with the remote host,
        select the file access method in the Access Project Files Via list. If the project files
        are in a shared folder accessible from the local host and remote host, select System-level
        File Sharing. If sharing the files is not possible, select Automatic Copying&nbsp;to copy
        the files. The files are copied to your <tt>.netbeans</tt> directory on the remote host.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>Tool Collection.</b> The tool collection list displays the collections found on the
      currently selected build host. The default collection for that selected host is listed in
      bold type. You can modify the tool collection list by adding or removing collections. Be sure
      to select the Build Host before you modify any information about the tool collection.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To add a collection to the list, click Add and specify the base directory in the Add New
        Tool Set dialog box. The base directory is usually a <tt>bin</tt> subdirectory. The Tool
        Set Family and Tool Set Name are filled in automatically by the IDE after it analyzes the
        tools in the base directory. You can specify a different name for the collection. If you
        change the family, make sure that the family you specify is the correct family for the
        collection or the compiler flags might not be valid.
      </li>
      <li>
        To remove a collection from the list, select the collection and click Remove.
      </li>
      <li>
        To duplicate a collection, select the collection from the list and modify the base
        directory, tool set family, or tool set name in the dialog box.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make a collection the default, select the collection and click Default. The default
        collection is used by default for new projects.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>Base Directory.</b> The base directory for compilers for the current build host. The path
      can be edited for the local host or remote hosts, but browsing to select a different path
      only works on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>C Compiler.</b> The C compiler command to use for building projects. The default compiler
      is the first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path to a compiler, or
      click the browse button to navigate to a different compiler on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>C++ Compiler.</b> The C++ compiler command to use for building projects. The default
      compiler is the first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path to a
      compiler, or click the browse button to navigate to a different compiler on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Fortran Compiler.</b> The Fortran compiler command to use for building projects. The
      default compiler is the first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path
      to a compiler, or click the browse button to navigate to a different compiler on the local
      host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Assembler.</b> The assembler utility to use to translate assembly language projects into
      machine code. The default assembler, if any, is the first one found in the base directory.
      You can type a different path to an assembler, or click the browse button to navigate to a
      different assembler on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Make Command.</b> The make command to use for building projects. The default command is
      the first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path to a make command,
      or click the browse button and navigate to a different command on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Debugger Command.</b> The gdb command to use when debugging projects. The default command
      is the first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path to a gdb command,
      or click the browse button and navigate to a different command on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <!--these might move somewhere else-->
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>QMake Command.</b> The path to the qmake command, which is used to generate makefiles for
      Qt projects. You can type the path to a qmake command, or click the browse button and
      navigate to a different command on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>CMake Command.</b> The path to the cmake command to use for projects with existing
      sources that use the CMake cross compiler. You can type a path to the cmake command, or click
      the browse button and navigate to a different command on the local host.
    </p>
    <p>
       The <b>Versions...</b> button displays the version numbers of each tool in the selected Tool
      Collection.
    </p>
    <p>
       The <b>Restore Defaults</b> button can be used to make the IDE search your environment for
      tool collections and update the paths to all the tools. If you have manually added a tool
      collection, the paths will not be changed.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Make Options.</b> Global options for the <tt>make</tt> command.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>File Path Mode.</b> The mode for storing file paths in a project. Always Relative mode
        stores paths as relative to the project root. Always Absolute mode stores paths as absolute
        paths. Auto mode stores paths as relative to the project root if inside the project,
        otherwise as absolute path.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Reuse Output Tabs from Finished Processes.</b> If selected, writes make output to a
        single Output window tab, deleting the output from the previous process. If not selected,
        opens a new tab for each make process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Enable dependency checking in generated makefiles.</b> Add <tt>make state</tt>
        statements to the makefile.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Show binary files in Projects view.</b> If selected, the Projects view shows all files
        in a directory tree, including binary objects. This option is most relevant to projects
        created with existing sources, which might place sources and binaries in the same location.
        Deselect this option to more easily see your C/C++ source files and header files.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Show warning dialog about missing makefiles due to mismatched platforms.</b> If
        selected, the IDE will warn you if you attempt to run a project that was created on a
        platform that is not the same as your current build host's platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Rebuild entire project if project properties have changed.</b> If selected, the IDE
        rebuilds the project if you change any project properties, even ones that should have no
        effect on build products. By default, this is not selected because dependency checking
        should ensure most required rebuilds. You might want to enable this option if you are using
        GNU tools and changing compiler or linker options does not cause a rebuild.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Resolve symbolic links.</b> If selected, and the build system uses symbolic links to source files,
        the IDE will add the original files to the project instead of the links. 
      </li>

        <b>Support indexing of non C/C++/Fortran files in projects (slows down parsing)</b> If
        selected, the IDE indexes project files that are not C, C++, or Fortran source files. By
        default, this option is not selected to speed up parsing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Reparse on File Change.</b> If this option is selected, your project is reparsed
        whenever files are modified. Normally this option should be enabled for code assistance to
        work correctly. However, if the project is very large, reparsing might cause delays, so you
        can deselect this option and reparse manually. Right-click the project and select Code
        Assistance &gt; Reparse Project.
