<answer id="arch-what">
Nodes API serves as the main aparatus for visualisation of objects
in NetBeans. Nodes augment objects with standard aspects used for
visualisation (e.g. name, displayName, icons, set of proerties, 
subnodes hierarchy, etc.) Once a Node is defined for given object
it can be visualised using diferent views e.g. trees, lists, tables etc.
Descripion of nodes can be found

            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.

     <question id="compat-version">
            Can your module coexist with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read all old settings? Will future
            versions be able to read your current settings? Can you read
            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
Nodes API itself does not use any kind of settings. Displayed nodes are 
persisted using serialization by default, but this can be changed
by developers by providing own persistence mechanism.

     <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resources provided by other modules in
            their layers?
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

     <question id="resources-read">
            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and clasify according to 
            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#categories">
            common stability categories</a>.

<!--
        <question id="exec-introspection">
            Does your module use any kind of runtime type information (<code>instanceof</code>,
            work with <code>java.lang.Class</code>, etc.)?
            <hint>
            Check for cases when you have an object of type A and you also
            expect it to (possibly) be of type B and do some special action. That
            should be documented. The same applies on operations in meta-level
            (Class.isInstance(...), Class.isAssignableFrom(...), etc.).
            </hint>
        </question>

<answer id="exec-introspection">
Yes. 
<ul>
<li>instanceof: 37 occurences</li>
<li>isAssgnableFrom: 5 occurences</li>
<li>isInstance: 3 occurences</li>
</ul>

<!--
        <question id="exec-process">
            Do you execute an external process from your module? How do you ensure
            that the result is the same on different platforms? Do you parse output?
            Do you depend on result code?
            <hint>
            If you feed an input, parse the output please declare that as an API.
            </hint>
