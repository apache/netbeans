<h2>Document Based DOM</h2>

The package contains DOM level 1 Core and XML module
implemetation. The implementation is read-only and is on the
fly constructed from Document token chain.

<h3>Open Issues</h3>
<p>
<b>Entity references</b> cannot be properly resolved as DTD part
and all external stuff is completelly ignored. A callback
interface can be established for this purpose:

<pre>
public interface EntityReferenceResolver {
    NodeList resolveEntityReference(EntityReference ref) throws IOException;
}
</pre>

<p>
<b>Attribute values</b> should report DTD defined defaults as it
cannot be also retrieved from token chain. In this case can be also
introduced a callback or does not stay fully with DOM spec. But is
it violation of spec? We are contruction DOM without DTD knowledge
so there are not default attributes declared.
