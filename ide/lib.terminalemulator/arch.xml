  This library primarily provides a JComponent class, Term, which can
  route user keyboard input to a client and display output from a
  client, possibly interpreting and processing the output as ANSI

 <answer id="arch-quality">
  <p/>
  Term can potentially be tested in two ways:
  <ul>
	  <li>
	  Against an external interactive application like vi, emacs, more,
	  various shells, man, dbx, gdb (or any application which uses
	  readline), mc (midnight commander), rogue/hack and so on.
	  <p>
	  The primary impediment to testing of Term is that for realistic
	  interaction it requires JNI-based pty support.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Proprietary code exists for such a pty library as well as a standalone
	  "TermApp" which are used to hand-test against some of the above
	  applications.
	  </p>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	  Using unit tests which can reset the "state" of the terminal,
	  issue an output, or a call sequence and verify that the resulting
	  state is the correct one.
	  <p>
	  No such unit tests are available at the moment.
	  </p>
	  </li>
  </ul>
  Since NB is considering incorporating JNA (Java Native Access) a non-JNI
  based library for accessing pty's becomes feasible in which case TermApp
  can make it into this module.

    The Terminal Emulator is a library used to display process output. It is
    designed to operate in a variety of modes, up to and including full
    emulation of an ANSI character terminal, similar to <code>xterm</code>
    and so on. NetBeans 3.X used it to implement the Output Window,
    where it mostly acted as a "dumb terminal" for use in capturing output
    from compilers and programs run by the user. It features hyperlinks which
    may be used for e.g. compiler error messages. In more advanced modes it
    can even be used to run e.g. VI or Emacs, display margin glyphs, and so
    on.

    <answer id="compat-standards">
        <p>
	The emulator has full compliance with the generic "dumb" terminal type.
	It has good but not 100% compliance with the general ANSI term specification
	given by ISO/IEC 6429:1992(E) / ANSI X3.64-1979.
	It has some functionality on top of ANSI which is modeled on
	the Solaris <code>dtterm</code>, but is not a full emulation of that
	termcap.
	Subprocesses expecting <code>xterm</code> or <code>vt220</code>
	emulation should generally work as well.
        </p>
        <p>
	The library package provides some API documentation for use by
	embedding applications. A subset of this API is used by the NetBeans
	<code>core-output.jar</code> module to implement the Output Window.

            Depending on other NetBeans projects influnces the ability of
            users of your work to customize their own branded version of
            NetBeans by enabling and disabling some modules. Too
            much dependencies restrict this kind of customization. If that
            is your case, then you may want to split your functionality into
            pieces of autoload, eager and regular modules which can be
            enabled independently. Usually the answer to this question

    No. There is a history buffer with a fixed number of lines, so output

            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and classify according to 
            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#categories">
            common stability categories</a>.

<!--
        <question id="security-grant" when="final">
            Does your code grant additional rights to some other code?
            <hint>Avoid using a class loader that adds extra
            permissions to loaded code unless really necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by
            calling AccessController.doPrivileged().</hint>

<!--
        <question id="security-policy" when="final">
            Does your functionality require modifications to the standard policy file?
            <hint>Your code might pass control to third-party code not
            coming from trusted domains. This could be code downloaded over the
            network or code coming from libraries that are not bundled
            with NetBeans. Which permissions need to be granted to which domains?</hint>
