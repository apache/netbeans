 * Entity resolver to make it possible to parse an RSS Feed (Version 0.91) with
 * an XMLReader. The license of the specification and the grammar file is 
 * unclear. As the grammer is not used in the welcome module and the stream is
 * manually parsed, only entities need to be resolved by the XML parser.
 * The XML stream can contain Latin-1 entities, which are taken
 * from the HTML 3.2 specification. Instead of the HTML 3.2 DTDs (SGML), the
 * XHTML specification is used as a replacement here.
