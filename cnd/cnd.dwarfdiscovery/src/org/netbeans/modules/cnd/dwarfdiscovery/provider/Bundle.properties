Binaries_Provider_Name=Analyze Object and Executable Files
Binaries_Provider_Description=Discovery feature analyzes information from object \
 or binary files that were built with debug information. \
 \nUse compile flags "-g3 -gdwarf-2" for GNU compilers.\
 \nUse compile flag "-g" for SUN compilers.\
 \nSome open source projects can be configured with the flags by following command:\
 \nconfigure CFLAGS="-g3 -gdwarf-2" CXXFLAGS="-g3 -gdwarf-2" \
 \nDo not forget to build the project with command: \
 \nmake
