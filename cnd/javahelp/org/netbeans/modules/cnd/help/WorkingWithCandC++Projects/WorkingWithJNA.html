          Navigating in the code editor from Java methods to their C/C++ implementation
        </td>

          Ctrl-click on the Java method and the code editor jumps to the C/C+ declaration or
          definition if it is found.

          Debugging both Java and C++ code.
        </td>
        <td width="50%">
          Unlike JNI, debugging of JNA doesn't support stepping into methods, so you must attach
          the native debugger and place breakpoints on your own.
