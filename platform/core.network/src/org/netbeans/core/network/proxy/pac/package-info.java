/**
 * Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) script related.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) script is a piece of JavaScript code
 * which is typically downloaded from the network. It is meant to be
 * evaluated on the client. The role of the PAC is to determine which 
 * proxy to use for a given URL.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Netscape wrote the original specification for the PAC script in 1995. The
 * specification has never been ratified as a standard but is widely implemented
 * on corporate Local Area Networks as a way to have a centralized and
 * configurable proxy setup.
