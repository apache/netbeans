<p>You can create a project from an existing binary if you have its source files.
    The IDE automatically finds the source files, adds them to the project,
    configures code assistance and explores project dependencies. </p>
<p>In addition to creating a project using the File <img src="../images/arrow.gif" width ="5" height="11"

    in <a href="CreatingCorC++Project.html">Creating a C or C++ Project></a>
you can do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag the binary file from the Favorites or Files window and drop
it in the Source Editor window. A <a href="CreateProject.html">
Create Project</a> dialog box opens.</li>
<li>Right-click the binary file in the Favorites or Files window and select Create Project.</li>
</ul>
