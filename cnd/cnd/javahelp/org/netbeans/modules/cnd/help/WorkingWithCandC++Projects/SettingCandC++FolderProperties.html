       Setting Folder Properties
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
       When you set the project properties for your C or C++ project, the relevant properties apply
      to all folders and files in the project.
    </p>
    <p>
       By default, a folder inherits the include directories , preprocessor definitions, and
      C/C++&nbsp;standard&nbsp;from the project. You can choose to have a folder not inherit these
      properties by modifying properties for one or several folders independently.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To modify folder properties:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the Projects window, select one or more folders, then right-click and choose Properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Project Properties dialog box, select the configuration for which you want to set a
        property.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select a node in the left panel and modify the property using the text fields, drop-down
        lists, check boxes, and buttons in the right panel.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       You can set the following properties for the files in selected folders:
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Include Directories.</b> Type the absolute or relative path to the
      directories containing headers for your project, or click the button to browse to the
      directories and add them. On the file browser dialog box, you can specify Absolute or
      Relative path. 
    </p>
     <p>
       <b>Include Headers.</b> Type the filename of the header file to include or click the button 
       to browse to the file and add it. The option causes
       the compiler to treat the header file as if it appears in your source files as an #include 
       directive. 
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Preprocessor Definitions.</b> Add definitions for macros used by the project. Click the
      text field or the button to open the Preprocessor Definitions dialog box to add definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>Preprocessor Undefined.</b> Add definitions for macros used by the project. Click the
      text field or the button to open the Preprocessor Definitions dialog box to add definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>C Standard.</b> Specifies whether project sources should be parsed as&nbsp;C89, 
       C99, or C11 code. When set to Default, use the compiler's default C standard.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>C++ Standard.</b> Specifies whether project sources should be parsed as&nbsp;C++98, 
      C++11, or C++14 code. When set to Default, use the compiler's default C++ standard.
    </p>
