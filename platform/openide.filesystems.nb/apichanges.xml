                <p>
                    The FileSystem.Status was entirely removed, as it references class java.awt.Image, which 
                    is not available in compact jdk profiles and may trigger GUI system initialization. See
                    javadocs of <a href="@org-openide-filesystems@/org/openide/filesystems/StatusDecorator.html">StatusDecorator</a>
                    for details.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The default implementation of FileSystem.Status annotated file's icon using ImageUtilities
                    which uses AWT graphics etc. Such dependency is not desirable in a standalone FileSystem API
                    library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The builtin implementation now does not work with the icon at all and returns null. A proper
                    implementation for FileSystem.Status is looked up in default Lookup and is implemented
                    properly (with Icon annotations) in <code>openide.filesystems.nb</code> module.

            <h2>What do the Dates Mean?</h2>
            <p>
                The supplied dates indicate when the API change was made, on the CVS
                trunk. From this you can generally tell whether the change should be
                present in a given build or not; for trunk builds, simply whether it
                was made before or after the change; for builds on a stabilization
                branch, whether the branch was made before or after the given date. In
                some cases corresponding API changes have been made both in the trunk
                and in an in-progress stabilization branch, if they were needed for a
                bug fix; this ought to be marked in this list.
