        <h2>GSF Parsing</h2>
        <blockquote style="background-color: #ffdddd; color: black; padding: 20px; border: solid 1px black">
            NOTE: There is a new Parsing API underway. This will be something
            equivalent to the Lexer API, but applied to parsing. The plan is for GSF
            to remove its own Parser registration and interfaces and replace it with
            the standard Parser API. This will allow embedding and coordination
            not just among GSF-based languages, but for all languages that implement
            the parsing API (such as Java, and C/C++, which are not GSF based).
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            You need to implement the
            <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/Parser.html">Parser</a> interface,
            and <a href="registration.html">register</a> it with GSF.
            Once you've done that, your Parser will be called whenever some feature
            needs a parse tree, and one isn't available or up to date already.
        </p>
        <p>
            Typically, you'll probably just wrap an existing parser here -
            for Ruby we're using the JRuby parser, for JavaScript we're using
            Rhino, for Groovy we're using groovyc, etc. However, you can
            obviously write a parser from scratch as well - I think that's the
            approach the PHP editor team has taken (though I'm not sure of the
            details).
        </p>
        <p>
            The key thing is that you parse the file, and then return a ParserResult
            from your Parser.  The ParserResult is typically going to be your
            <b>own</b> subclass of <code>ParserResult</code> where you store
            additional state, such as your own AST (abstract syntax tree).
            Then, when you're implementing the various features, you're
            handed back your own <code>ParserResult</code>, you can cast it
            to your own result class and pull out the AST which you can then
            use to do semantic code analysis.
        </p>
        <h3>Error Recovery</h3>
        <p>
            One of the trickiest part about wrapping an existing parser, is handling
            error recovery.  Most parsers aren't used to having to deal with
            erroneous source - well, they can abort with an error message.
            In the IDE however, parsing broken source is the norm. If the
            user is trying to do code completion, the source code may look like
            this:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
            def foo(bar)
               bar.|
            end
            </pre>
            the user is trying to complete methods on the bar symbol - but obviously
            the source is currently broken. Your parser needs to be able to handle
            this scenario!
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a number of strategies for attacking this problem. You
            can take a look at the RubyParser and the JsParser implementations
            for Ruby and JavaScript for some inspiration.
        </p>
        <h3>Incremental Parsing</h3>
        <p>
          GSF supports incremental parsing. This is described in the separate
          <a href="incremental-parsing.html">incremental parsing</a> document.
