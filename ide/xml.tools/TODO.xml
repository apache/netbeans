        <summary>Cleanup files structure</summary>
        <description>Files' structure is not synoptical. I see two possible structures:
<ul>
    <li><b>By services</b> - each service has its own folder which contains cookies,
        actions, impl, wizard, ...</li>
    <li><b>By class types</b> - separated parts (cookies, actions, impl, wizard, ...) of
        each service are in common folder.</li>
</ul>
