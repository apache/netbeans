# On Windows ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with a path to "<AppData>/NetBeans" folder where <AppData> is user's
# value of AppData key in Windows Registry under
#   Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders
# ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with a path to "<Local AppData>/NetBeans/Cache" folder where <Local AppData>
# is user's value of Local AppData key in Windows Registry under

#
# On Mac ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with a path to ~/Library/Application Support/NetBeans
# ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} with a path to ~/Library/Caches/NetBeans
#
# On other systems ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced with
# a path to ~/.netbeans folder in user's home and
# ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} with a path to ~/.cache/netbeans folder.
#
# You can also use ${HOME} which will be replaced by user.home
# system property.
#
# NOTE: If you specify a non-default userdir path, the cachedir path
# will be mapped to <userdir>/var/cache folder.

# Note that default -Xmx is selected for you automatically.
# You can find these values in var/log/messages.log file in your userdir.
# The automatically selected value can be overridden by specifying -J-Xmx
# here or on the command line.

# Default location of JDK, can be overridden by using --jdkhome <dir>
# Be careful when changing jdkhome. There are two launchers - 32-bit and 64-bit.
# Which one is used depends on JVM architecture.

# If you have some problems with detect of proxy settings, you may want to enable
# detect the proxy settings provided by JDK5 or higher.
# In such case add -J-Djava.net.useSystemProxies=true to the netbeans_default_options.
