Ways of getting information about Ant-based projects useful from other projects.

<p>An {@link org.netbeans.api.project.ant.AntArtifact} is a representation of a
build product created from a (somehow Ant-based) project. Rather than relying on
details of how another project arranges its builds, a parent project can use
{@link org.netbeans.api.project.ant.AntArtifactQuery} to find Ant artifacts from
another project (or, perhaps, arbitrary source not formally contained in a
project). Using artifact information it is possible to tell what build product
(file or directory) will be created and what general sort it is (e.g. JAR vs.
Javadoc); which Ant script and target to run to create that build product; and
how to request that it be cleaned. This information suffices to create an Ant
build script in the parent project that can run sub-builds.</p>
