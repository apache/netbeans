  Provides a set of classes for setting properties by custom editors.
<p>If there exist special custom editor for property, there appears small
"..." button which invokes such custom editor dialog. Custom editor is embedded
in a dialog. If it is property of a component from Form Editor, dialog contains
Default, OK and Cancel buttons, combo box enabling to change editor (e.g.
PointEditor/Form Connection), button "Advanced" to call "Advanced Initialization
Code" dialog (see <a href="@org-netbeans-modules-jellytools-java@/org/netbeans/jellytools/modules/form/properties/editors/package-summary.html">org.netbeans.jellytools.modules.form.properties.editors</a>).
Otherwise it is dialog with OK and Cancel buttons (Default and Help are optional).
A custom editor is extended from&nbsp; NbDialogOperator. Custom editor operator contains high-level
methods to get or set compound property value in one method by custom editor.
These methods are then used in tests or in specialized property implementation
(see {@link org.netbeans.jellytools.properties}).<br>
