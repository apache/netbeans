     Either height or relative-height must be specified.

     "centered-horizontally" is true when main window is centered horizontally

     "centered-vertically" is true when main window is centered vertically

     "maximize-if-width-below" and

     It is to avoid main window size bigger than screen size (width or height).

     "frame-state" represents state of frame.
     It is represented as bitwise mask - integer value.

     "orientation" sets orientation of splitter. "horizontal" means splitting
     along x axis - components are from left to right. "vertical" means splitting
     along y axis - components are from top to bottom.
     "number" sets number of cell in given split cell. It is integer number. Number defines
     position of given cell in array of cells. It is possible to define for example
     20 for first cell and 40 for second cell. Later it is possible to insert third cell between
     first and second by using 30 for third cell. It is usefull for platform to allow third party
     modules to modify (insert) their own modes to existing layout.
     Cells are counted from left to right in case of vertical split and
     from top to bottom in case of horizontal split.
     "weight" is double number from 0 to 1. It sets relative size of cell
     in given splitter. Default value is 0.5.
