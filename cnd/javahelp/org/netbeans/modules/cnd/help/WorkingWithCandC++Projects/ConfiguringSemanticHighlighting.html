<h2>Configuring Highlighting for C and C++ Projects</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>
You can use the Options window to configure semantic highlighting for your
C and C++ projects.  The IDE can display various code elements with text highlights
such as different colors, underlining, or font weights to make the code easier to understand.</p>
<p>Tip: See Tools &gt; Options &gt; Editor &gt; Hints &gt; C/C++ for other ways to change
the IDE's display.</p>
<p><b>To configure highlighting:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose Tools &gt; Options.</li>
<li>
Click Editor in the top pane of the window.
</li>
<li>Click the Highlighting tab.</li>
<li>Choose C/C++ in the Language list.</li>
<li>
Modify the properties as desired.</li>
</ol>
<p>
You can set the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mark Occurrences of Symbol Under Caret.</b> If this option is selected, then
when you click on a class, function, variable, or macro, all occurrences
of that class, function, variable, or macro in the current file are
highlighted.
</li>
<li><b>Keep Marks.</b> If this option is selected, highlighted classes,
functions, variable, and macros remain highlighted until you move the cursor to another symbol.
</li>
<li><b>Highlight Inactive Code.</b> If this option selected, inactive code
is highlighted.
</li>
<li><b>Highlight Macros.</b> If this option selected, macros are highlighted.
</li>
<li>
        <b>Highlight Class Fields Declarations.</b> If this option selected, class field
        declarations are highlighted.
      </li>
<li><b>Highlight Class Fields.</b> If this option selected, class
fields are highlighted.
</li>
<li>
        <b>Highlight Function Declarations and Definitions.</b> If this option selected, function
        declarations and definitions are highlighted.
      </li>
<li><b>Highlight Function Names.</b> If this option selected,
function names are highlighted.
</li>

<li><b>Highlight Typedefs.</b> If this option is selected,
typedefs are highlighted.
</li>
<li><b>Highlight Unused Variables.</b> If this option is selected, unused variables are highlighted.</li>
<li><b>Highlight Syntax Errors.</b> If this option is selected, syntax errors are highlighted.</li>
<li><b>Show Overridden Annotations.</b> If this option is selected, the editor will show pop-up annotations for
methods that override a parent method, or that are overridden by a descendent class. The annotations contain links to
the associated methods and classes.</li>
