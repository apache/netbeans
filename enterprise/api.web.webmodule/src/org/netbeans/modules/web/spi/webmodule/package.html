SPI for providers of J2EE web modules and frameworks.

<p>This API will typically be used by modules that implement project types for
J2EE web module (various implementations of web module project, web module with
web services, portlets, etc.). It can be also used for implementation of web
module that is not based on Projects API. Another use case is implementing
support for web frameworks such as Struts or JSF.</p>

<p>A module that implements this API needs to expose an implementation of
{@link org.netbeans.modules.web.spi.webmodule.WebModuleProvider} either in
the project lookup (for implementations based on the Projects API) or in the global lookup.
The module will implement {@link org.netbeans.modules.web.spi.webmodule.WebModuleImplementation}
and use {@link org.netbeans.modules.web.spi.webmodule.WebModuleFactory}
to create a {@link org.netbeans.modules.web.api.webmodule.WebModule}.</p>

<p>A module wanting to provide support for a web framework needs to implement
{@link org.netbeans.modules.web.spi.webmodule.WebFrameworkProvider} and usually
also {@link org.netbeans.modules.web.spi.webmodule.WebModuleExtender}.</p>
