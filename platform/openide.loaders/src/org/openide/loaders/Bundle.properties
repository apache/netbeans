OpenIDE-Module-Name=Datasystems API
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=NetBeans Open API for manipulating data objects.
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    The Datasystems API is a layer atop the Filesystems API which recognizes \
    and groups data objects and gives them particular semantics. Once a part \
    of the general Open APIs, it is now split into an independent module.
