            Please provide here few lines describing the the project,
            what problem it should solve, provide links to documentation,

<answer id="arch-what">
The editor module provides a full-featured source text editor
that is integrated with the Form Editor, Explorer, compiler, and debugger. 
<p>List of the main features:</p>
<ul>

    <li>Syntax highlighting of java, HTML, XML and other languages.</li>
  <li>Code Completion enables to type a few characters 
        and then display a list of suggestions appropriate
        in the given context that can be then used 
        to automatically complete the expression.
  </li>
  <li>Word Matching enables enables to type the beginning characters
        of a word used elsewhere in the code and then have the editor
        generate the rest of the word.
  </li>
  <li>Abbreviations allow to expand typed text from a few
        predefined characters into a full word or phrase.
  </li>
  <li>Goto Class enables to open a Java file in the Source Editor 
        by typing only the class name.
        The IDE helps to identify the correct package name for the class.
  </li>
  <li>The Fast Import feature enables to quickly add import statements
        for Java classes in the source file.
  </li>
  <li>Goto Declaration feature allows to quickly jump to a declaration
        of a variable under the cursor.
  </li>
  <li>Goto Source allows to open source file containing
        definition of a type that the variable under the cursor is of.
  </li>
  <li>Code folding allows to collapse sections of the code that are
        unimportant to the user at the given time.
        For example in java source the collapsable sections include
        imports section, inner classes, methods and javadocs.
  </li>
</ul>

<answer id="arch-overall">
The editor functionality are mainly implementations of the Swing Text package APIs
plus extension features such as Syntax Coloring, Code Completion,
Word Matching, Abbreviations or Macros.

<p>
The editor consists of a library part (located under <i>editor/lib</i>
and described in a separate arch document)
and the module part (under <i>src</i> subfolder)
that depends on  NetBeans APIs specified in this document.

<!-- Question: compat-i18n

     <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions

<!-- Question: compat-version

     <question id="compat-version">
            Does your module properly coexists with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read settings? Will future
            versions be able to read settings?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
    Only one version of the module can be installed at a time. 
    The settings are shared across different versions, they are stored
    in a human readable form in XML files.
