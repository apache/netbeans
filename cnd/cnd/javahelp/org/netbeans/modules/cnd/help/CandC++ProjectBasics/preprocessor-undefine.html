<h2>Preprocessor Undefined Dialog Box</h2>
<p>To add a preprocessor macro undefine, click Add and type the macro name in the
Add text field of the Edit dialog box. Do not use a <tt>-U</tt> flag.
Specify only the name of the macro you want to undefine. Add
a separate entry for each definition.
<p>Adjust the order of the definitions by using the Up and Down buttons.</p>
<p>If you are setting preprocessor undefines for a file, definitions are
inherited from the file's project by default. If you do not want the
file to inherit preprocessor undefines from the project, click the
Inherit from Project checkbox to remove the checkmark.
