            XML/Multiview offers suppport for implementing editors with multiple views for xml files.
            <usecase id="basic-usage" name="Basic usage">
                To implement an xml multiview editor using the framework, you need to provide the following components:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An appropriate data loader that recognizes required MIME type.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A data object that should extend <tt>XmlMultiviewDataObject</tt>. This object 
                        is responsible for parsing the underlying xml document and for providing means to access the model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A model synchonizer that extends <tt>XmlMultiViewDataSynchronizer</tt>. The model 
                        synchonizer takes care of performing synchronization between the model and binary 
                        data and it is responsible for writing the model. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A tool bar multiview element that extends <tt>ToolBarMultiViewElement</tt> for each design view. 
                        This component is responsible for repainting the view when necessary and generally it also 
                        provides the actions that can be performed in each view. Alternatively you can also use 
                        <tt>TreePanelMultiViewElement</tt>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A panel for each element to displayed in design view, should extend <tt>SectionInnerPanel</tt>. 
                        This panel is responsible for registering components that modify the model with SectionInnerPanel 
                        and for setting values into the model by overriding setValue method. It should also 
                        validate the model and display appropriate error messages if needed. This panel is created by
                        <tt>InnerPanelFactory</tt>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                An example implementation is included in the unit test packages of the module, 
                see <tt>org.netbeans.modules.xml.multiview.test</tt>. 
            </usecase> 
            <usecase id="how-to-synchronizer" name="How to implement a model synchronizer?">
                <p>To provide synchronization between the model and data you need to implement a model synchronizer that should 
                extend <tt>XmlMultiViewDataSynchronizer</tt>. In the implementation of <tt>updateDataFromModel</tt>
                you are required to implement writing of the model to the disk <b>and</b> update the data cache. For example: </p>
                <pre>
            protected void updateDataFromModel(Object model, FileLock lock, boolean modify) {
                ...
                Writer out = new StringWriter();
                // write model
                ((MyModel) model).write(out);
                out.close();
                // update data cache
                getDataCache().setData(lock, out.toString(), modify);
                ...
            }
                </pre>
                <p> In the implementation of <tt>reloadDataFromModel</tt>
                you are required implement reloading of the model from the disk. </p>
            </usecase>
            <usecase id="how-to-xmldataobject" name="How to implement an xml multiview data object?">
                As noted above, the data object you want to associate with the multiview, must extend <tt>XmlMultiViewDataObject</tt>. 
                You should provide the design views you want to enable in the implementation of the <tt>getMultiViewDesc()</tt>
                method (see the part about how to implement a design multiview description below).
            </usecase>
            <usecase id="how-to-designviewdesc" name="How to implement a design multiview description?">
                Your design view description should extend <tt>DesignViewMultiViewDesc</tt> that 
                implements <tt>org.netbeans.core.spi.multiview.MultiViewDescription</tt>. As the name implies, it 
                represents a description of a design view in a multiview editor. In the implementation
                of the abstract <tt>createElement</tt> method you should create an appropriate view element (see next item).
            </usecase>
            <usecase id="how-to-multiviewelement" name="How to implement a multiview element?">
                <tt>MultiViewElement</tt> provides UI components for the multiview component. The XML/multiview provides three types
                of multiview elements, namely <tt>ToolBarMultiViewElement, TreePanelMultiViewElement and XmlMultiViewElement</tt>. 
                Basic usage of each is described below. <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li><tt>ToolBarMultiViewElement</tt> - to implement your own ToolBarMultiViewElement, you need to
                    provide appropriate <tt>SectionView</tt> in your <tt>getSectionView()</tt> method. Furthermore, 
                    you might want to override <tt>componentShowing()</tt> method and reinitialize the view 
                    if something has changed. To know whether something has changed, you can listen on property changes
                    of the underlying model or alternatively you can always reinitialize the view. If you choose to 
                    listen on property changes you might want to create a <tt>Task</tt> (using <tt>RequestProcessor.create</tt>)
                    with an appropriate delay to avoid reinitializing the view multiple time when there are several property
                    changes within a short period.</li>

            <usecase id="how-to-sectionview" name="How to use section view?">
                <tt>SectionView</tt> represents the view associated with a <tt>MultiViewElement</tt>. It contains the 
                actual sections to be displayed. Your implementation should add the sections you need by using 
                <tt>addSection(NodeSectionPanel section)</tt>. Note that there is also <tt>SectionContainer</tt>
                that can be used for grouping <tt>SectionPanel</tt>s and that the actual panel associated with 
                each <tt>SectionPanel</tt> is created by your implementation <tt>InnerPanelFactory</tt>. You can set
                the <tt>InnerPanelFactory</tt> implementation to the <tt>SectionView</tt> implementation by using
                <tt>setInnerPanelFactory(InnerPanelFactory factory)</tt> method.
            </usecase>
            <usecase id="how-to-sectionpanel" name="How to use section panel?">
                The XML/multiview provides a base class, <tt>SectionInnerPanel</tt>, for panels to be used in visual views. You can
                provide your own subclass of <tt>SectionInnerPanel</tt> by making your implementation of <tt>InnerPanelFactory</tt>
                to return appropriate panels. Usually panels contain UI components that represent the state of the model. Moreover, 
                they might also need to modify the model (unless you mean to provide only a read-only view). For that purpose
                <tt>SectionInnerPanel</tt> has several methods that can be used to register components that modify the model. There
                are two variants of these methods, <tt>addModifier(JComponent)</tt> and <tt>addImmediateModifier(JComponent)</tt> 
                (more specifically, there is an overloaded version for several subtypes of JComponent). After a component is registered 
                using either of the variants, <tt>setValue(Object)</tt> method gets called when the state
                of the components changes. The difference between these two variants is that in case of <tt>addModifier(JComponent)</tt> 
                <tt>setValue(Object)</tt> gets called when the component loses focus, whereas <tt>addImmediateModifier(Jcomponent)</tt>
                causes <tt>setValue(Object)</tt> immediately when the state of the component has changed.
            </usecase>
            <usecase id="how-to-sectionnode" name="SectionInnerPanel vs. SectionNodeInnerPanel">
                The module provides two "styles" of building visual views. The first approach has been discussed above, the second
                approach is to utilize various *Node classes that the module provides, such as SectionNode, SectionNodeView and 
                SectionNodeInnerPanel. For the most part everything discussed above applies to the latter approach also, basically using 
                it is more suitable for UIs that have several
                expandable nested panels. For example, the editor for ejb-jar.xml (for EJB 2.x) uses this approach.

 <answer id="arch-what">
  <p>
      The J2EE Multiview Editor Framework is intended to be an infrastructure 
(or workshop) for building various design editors in Netbeans 4.1 (or higher).
  </p>
  <p>
The need to logically and visually organize applications is not confined 
to the project, but permeates the entire development experience. At the module-level, 
developers and analysts want to understand the relationship of the various components. 
At the component-level, developers benefit from a quick summary of their component, 
without needing to scan one or more source files. For example, the ability 
to combine the Java or XML source view of a component with its metadata and 
deployment descriptor information is a huge problem in the descriptor-happy world of J2EE.
  </p>
  <p>
Design Editors, supplementing and integrated with the Java or XML source editor, 
are being created for several key components in J2EE. In particular, an EJB Design Editor 
will make the horrendous task of property and deployment descriptor editing more manageable. 
Further, a Web Services Design Editor will streamline the process of creating web services, 
making J2EE and Netbeans IDE more accessible to the growing "Web Services" segment of the developer community.

        <question id="security-grant" when="final">
            Does your code grant additional rights to some other code?
            <hint>Avoid using a class loader that adds extra
            permissions to loaded code unless really necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by
            calling AccessController.doPrivileged().</hint>

<!--
        <question id="security-policy" when="final">
            Does your functionality require modifications to the standard policy file?
            <hint>Your code might pass control to third-party code not
            coming from trusted domains. This could be code downloaded over the
            network or code coming from libraries that are not bundled
            with NetBeans. Which permissions need to be granted to which domains?</hint>
