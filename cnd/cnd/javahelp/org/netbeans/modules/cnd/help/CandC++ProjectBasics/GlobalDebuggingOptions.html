<li><b>Auto Start Process After Program Was Loaded.</b> Determines
whether the loaded program begins running immediately.</li>
<li><b>Balloon Expression Evaluation.</b> Determines whether the balloon
expression evaluation feature is enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Window Properties:</p>

<li><b>Open the Sessions View When Loading a Second Session.</b> Determines
whether the Sessions tab is opened when a second debugging session

<li><b>Maximum Lines Of Output For list Command.</b> Determines the
maximum number of lines of output for the dbx <tt>list</tt> command.</li>
