        <question id="arch-what">
            What is this project good for?
            <hint>
            Please provide here few lines describing the the project, 
            what problem it should solve, provide links to documentation, 
            specifications, etc.
            </hint>
        </question>

<answer id="arch-what">
The IDE uses a small interface to describe the execution of Java-based
classes together with arguments. The 
<api name="ExecutionAPI" url="@org-openide-execution@/org/openide/execution/doc-files/api.html"
  type="export" category="official"
	group="java" />
controls the execution
of user-level classes. The system may have several different types
of executors simultaneously installed. By default we provide so called
External Execution for running a user code by an external process and
Internal Execution for running the user code in the same virtual machine
as the IDE.

        <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.

No.

<!--
        <question id="compat-version">
            Can your module coexist with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read all old settings? Will future
            versions be able to read your current settings? Can you read
            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>

            Some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org">libraries</a>) and
            it is prefered to use this approach when more modules may

            they refer to each other. 
            If it consist of module JAR(s) and other files, please describe

            public?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used
            whenever possible (<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/download/apis/org/openide/doc-files/upgrade.html#3.4-public-packages">
            public packages

            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="deploy-packages">
core-execution.jar does not define any public packages. So the public classes
in this jar are made inaccessible by the NetBeans module system.
openide-execution.jar contains publicly accessible classes (no protection
by the module system needed in this case).

            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an
            API as well.

            If there is a property that can change the behaviour of your
