            <hint>
            Depending on 3rd party libraries is always problematic,
            especially if they are not open source, as that complicates
            the licensing scheme of NetBeans. Please enumerate your

            some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org/">libraries</a>) and

                Is your API threadsafe? Can it be accessed from any threads or

                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures

                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex

 <answer id="exec-threading">
  <p>
   The LSP server executes on a single thread that receives messages. The LSP protocol works with CompletableFutures to indicate eventual completion of
    the task. Any longer work must be forked off to a separate thread, so the main reception thread is not blocked. In a sense the reception thread acts like
    the event dispatch thread in desktop platform app.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main entry point establishes a connection-specifc <b>defautl Lookup</b> that is propagated to individual RequestProcessor tasks so that the asynchronously
    executed code can connect with the originating client.

            Does your functionality require modifications to the standard policy file?
            <hint>Your code might pass control to third-party code not
            coming from trusted domains. This could be code downloaded over the
            network or code coming from libraries that are not bundled
            with NetBeans. Which permissions need to be granted to which domains?</hint>
