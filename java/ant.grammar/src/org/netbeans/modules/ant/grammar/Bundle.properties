OpenIDE-Module-Name=Ant Code Completion
OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Tools
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Code completion for textual editing of Ant scripts.
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This module permits you to use code completion when editing Ant scripts in the \
    NetBeans source editor. It will suggest attributes and subelements that can be \
    added to the current element you are editing. Completion knows about all standard \
    Ant tasks and types, as well as custom-defined tasks and types, and works with \
    nested data structures just as Explorer-based editing of Ant scripts does. \
    The module requires either the XML Text or XML Tree modules (or both) to be enabled.
