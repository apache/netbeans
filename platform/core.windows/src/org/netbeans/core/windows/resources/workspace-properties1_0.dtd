-//NetBeans//DTD Workspace Properties 1.0//EN

<!-- The root element for workspace properties. Consists of name, optional
    module information and workspace property sets for various types of user
    interface.
    Atribute "version" is optional versioning attribute, which in fact specifies
    version of this DTD. Attribute is used to perform simple versioning
    without the need to use time-consuming xml validation using this DTD.

<!-- Element for user interface type, holds property set for workspace for
    specific user interface type. UI type is identified by its only attribute "type",
    Value "any" is special value which is reserved for default setting set which
    is used when property set for specific ui-type is not found. Thus, simplest variant is to
    define only one property set with type "any", which means that for all
    types of user interface workspace will have same properties. -->
<!ELEMENT ui-type (cascade?, active?, order?, mode?, toolbar?) >

<!-- Optional element for module information. Module information is used for
    automatic removal of workspace defined by module if module is unistalled.
    If you want your module's workspace to be unistalled automatically when
    your module is deinstalled, fill this element. When this element is missing,
    no automatic removal will be done.
 1) "name" code name of the module, can be either base code name or full code
    name with slash and release number. Examples for core module are: 
    "org.netbeans.core" or "org.netbeans.core/1"
 2) "spec" is specification version of the module which defines this xml description.

<!-- Element name has four attributes:
    1) "unique" represents UID of the workspace
    2) "display" represents optional display name of the workspace.
       If display name is not specified, unique name is used as display name
       too. If "from-bundle" flag is enabled, this attribute must contain
       bundle key where to find localized display name.
    3) "from-bundle" flag to control if display name is taken from bundle or not
    4) "bundle" identifies bundle from which localized display name will be read.
       Format is the same like for fully qualified classes. For example, 
       localization bundle named "Bundle" in package "my.package" can be pointed
       to by value "my.package.Bundle".
       Attributes "bundle" and "display" together give fully qualified bundle
       pointer. This attribute is optional, has no meaning if "from-bundle" is false

<!-- Optional element description has two attributes
    1) "display" represents bundle key where to find localized 
        workspace description. (example value: "CTL_MyWorkspaceDescription")
    2) "bundle" identifies bundle from which localized description will be read.
       Format is the same like for fully qualified classes. For example, 
       localization bundle named "Bundle" in package "my.package" can be pointed
       to by value "my.package.Bundle".
       Attributes "bundle" and "display" together give fully qualified bundle
