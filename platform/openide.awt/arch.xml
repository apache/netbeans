            Usually a module consist of one JAR file (perhaps with Class-Path
            extensions) and also a configuration file that enables it. If you

            public?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used

            public packages
            </a>). If you do not restrict access to your classes you are
            making it too easy for other people to misuse your implementation
            details, that is why you should have good reason for not 
            restricting package access.

            If you provide an ant task that users can use, you need to be very
            careful about its syntax and behaviour, as it most likely forms an
	          API for end users and as there is a lot of end users, their reaction

            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to?
            <hint>
                If your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
                Also describe when any events are fired: synchronously, asynchronously, etc.
