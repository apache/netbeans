       For a C/C++ Project With Existing Sources, the Configure Code Assistance wizard lets you
      specify how your code will be parsed by the built-in parser used for the code assistance
      features of the IDE.
    </p>
    <p>
       Depending on which analyzer you selected on the Configure Code Assistance page, the Select
      Analyzed File(s) page lets you specify one of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An executable or library file, and additional library files
      </li>
      <li>
        The location of your project's exec log
      </li>
      <li>
        The location of your project's build or make log
      </li>
      <li>
        The root folder where the object files for your project are located
      </li>
      <li>
        The root folder where the header files for your project are located
