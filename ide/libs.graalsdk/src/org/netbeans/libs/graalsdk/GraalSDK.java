/**
 * Integration of <a href="@org-netbeans-api-scripting@/overview-summary.html">NetBeans Scripting</a>
 * API and GraalVM; see the {@link org.netbeans.libs.graalsdk tutorial} for more details.
 * <h2>Security</h2>
 * <p>
 * By default all the <a href="http://graalvm.org">GraalVM</a> engines
 * (named <code>GraalVM:something</code>)
 * run in a very restricted, secure sandbox:
 * </p>
 * {@snippet file="org/netbeans/libs/graalsdk/impl/GraalContext.java" region="SANDBOX"}
 * <p>
 * The languages cannot access local files, ports, etc. They can access <b>public</b>
 * fields and <b>public</b> methods of objects passed into their scripts (but not
 * those methods exposed by base {@link Object} class). The scripts can access
 * elements of Java arrays and {@link List} elements. Methods of a 
 * {@linkplain FunctionalInterface functional interfaces} are callable by the 
 * scripts.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For some languages such restrictions are too tight. They
 * need to gain wider access. This can be done by setting <code>allowAllAccess</code>
 * attribute to {@code true}:
 * </p>
 * {@snippet file="org/netbeans/libs/graalsdk/ScriptingTutorial.java" region="allowAllAccess"}
 * <p>
 * Once enabled, the {@link HostAccess#ALL} and {@link Builder#allowAllAccess(boolean) allowAllAccess(true)}
 * is then used to construct the engine's environment.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Polyglot API Access</h2>
 * <p>
 * As a consequence of packaging the GraalVM APIs, it is possible to request this module and gain access to
 * {@link org.graalvm.polyglot} package directly. Consult {@link Context} and {@link Engine}
 * classes as a starting points when
 * accessing the Graal SDK directly. Preferably use only if the 
 * <a href="@org-netbeans-api-scripting@/overview-summary.html">NetBeans Scripting</a>
 * API wrapper isn't good enough.
