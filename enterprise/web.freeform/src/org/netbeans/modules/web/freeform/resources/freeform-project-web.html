    Imports an existing Web application and its build script into an IDE project.
    In free-form projects, IDE commands use the Ant script that you provide to run,
    compile, and debug your project. Any modification of the build process must be
    handled directly in your Ant script. To make long-term maintenance of the
    project easier, consider using the Web Application with Existing Sources project
    template.
