            This package contains classes that you can subclass and register to
            lookups of nodes if you want to specify how the nodes should be
            searched. For this, use
            <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/search/SearchInfoDefinition.html">SearchInfoDefinition</a></code>
            or <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/search/SubTreeSearchOptions.html">SubTreeSearchOptions</a></code>,
            and possibly <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/search/SearchFilterDefinition.html">SearchFilterDefinition</a></code>
            and <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/search/SearchInfoDefinitionFactory.html">SearchInfoDefinitionFactory</a></code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add a custom search scope to <i>Find in Projects</i> dialog,
            you will need to subclass
            <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/search/SearchScopeDefinition.html">SearchScopeDefinition</a></code>
            and <code><a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/search/SearchScopeDefinitionProvider.html">SearchScopeDefinitionProvider</a></code>.
