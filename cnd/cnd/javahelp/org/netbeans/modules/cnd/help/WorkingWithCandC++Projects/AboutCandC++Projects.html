    <p>
       A project is a group of C, C++, or Fortran source files, and the settings with which you
      build, run, and debug those source files. In the IDE, all development has to take place
      within a project.
    </p>
    <p>
       The IDE stores all of the information about your project in makefiles, a properties file,
      and a few XML configuration files. You can build and run your projects outside the IDE
      exactly the same as inside the IDE.
    </p>
    <p>
       The IDE provides the following C/C++ project templates:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        C/C++ Project With Existing Sources
      </li>
      <li>
        C/C++ Project From Binary File
      </li>
      <li>
        C/C++ Application
      </li>
      <li>
        C/C++ Dynamic Library
      </li>
      <li>
        C/C++ Static Library
      </li>
      <li>
        C/C++ Qt Application
      </li>
      <li>
        C/C++ Qt Dynamic Library
      </li>
      <li>
        C/C++ Qt Static Library
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       The C/C++ Project With Existing Sources template and the C/C++ Project With Remote Existing
      Sources template import source code into the IDE project structure. The IDE relies on your
      existing makefile for instructions on how to compile and run your application. The settings
      you specify in the New Project wizard as well as in the Project Properties dialog box are
      used to tell the IDE how your makefile manages your source code and must be consistent with
      the settings in your makefile. These templates work for Fortran sources as well as C and C++.
    </p>
    <p>
       The C/C++ Project from Binary File template lets you create a project from an existing
      binary.
    </p>
    <p>
       With a C/C++ Application, Dynamic Library, or Static Library project, the IDE controls all
      aspects of how your application is built, run, and debugged. You specify project settings
      when creating the project and in the Project Properties dialog box. The IDE generates a
      makefile in which all of your settings are stored. The C/C++ Application, C/C++ Dynamic
      Library, and C/C++ Static Library templates also work for Fortran projects.
    </p>
    <p>
       With a C/C++ Qt Application, Qt Dynamic Library, or Qt Static Library project, the IDE uses
      an IDE-generated makefile and qmake .pro file to build your project. These templates can only
      be used with C and C++ because the qmake build system does not natively support Fortran. See
      <a href="AboutQtProjects.html">About Qt Projects</a> for more information.
