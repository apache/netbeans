        <h1>GSF</h1>
        <p>
            GSF is a language infrastructure for NetBeans.
            The purpose of GSF is to help create first-class editing support
            for a group languages (like Ruby, Groovy, JavaScript, Python, Scala,
            PHP, etc). By "first-class" editing support I mean all the features
            that we currently have for Java in NetBeans. Deep editing support
            including intelligent code completion, quick fixes and hints,
            and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            The abbreviation
            "GSF" is an historical artifact and a new name should probably be
            assigned.
        </p>
        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            The GSF API is intended for "language plugins". These are modules
            which add support for new languages (such as Ruby, JavaScript,
            HTML, CSS and so on) to NetBeans. 
            
            The <b>key philosophy</b> behind GSF is:
            <blockquote style="background-color: #ffddff; color: black; padding: 20px; border: solid 1px black">
                The language plugin deals <b>only</b> with language specific details.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            The implication of this is that nearly all UI, and all "infrastructure"
            code like listening on editor changes, scheduling parsing, implementing editor
            actions etc. are handled by the GSF infrastructure. A language plugin should
            just focus on specific features as they pertain to this language.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are trying to get started writing a new language using GSF,
            see the <a href="getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> document,
            which will try to order the tasks involved and point to the relevant
            sections.
        </p>
        <h3>Example: Instant Rename</h3>
        <p>
            For an example of this, take a look at the following diagram. This shows
            how "Instant Rename" works in GSF. The Instant Rename action itself
            (editor action implementation, keybinding registration, etc.) is provided
            by GSF.   The language plugin implements two services:
            <ul>
                <li> A parser - which produces a parse tree. This is used for most
                features in GSF.
                <li> An "InstantRenamer" - a simple interface where the language plugin
                is handed one of its own parse trees, and it needs to answer two
                questions:
                <ol>
                    <li>Is the given caret offset renameable? (And if not, provide
                        some error message to explain why, or an indication that refactoring
                    needs to be involved.</li>)
                    <li>Produce a set of offset ranges (begin to end) for all the 
                        instances of this symbol that should be renamed together.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            Here's the flow - the left side is what happens on the GSF side, and
            the right side is what happens in the language plugin:
            <br/>
            <img src="instant-rename.png" />
            <br/>
            <br/>
            One important thing to notice here is that on the GSF side, there
            is <b>NO</b> interpretation of the parser result in any way. GSF asks
            you to parse your code, and hands the parser result back to you
            as part of the implementation of many features.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, GSF provides implementations for a lot of the UI
            and interactions that you need for deep editing support for your language.
            You implement your lexer, parser, and feature implementations like
            code completion, go to declaration, quickfixes etc. based on analyzing
            your own parse trees.  You talk through feature specific APIs to GSF,
            and GSF does the rest.
        </p>
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            Here's a rough architecture diagram for GSF:
            <br/>
            <img src="gsf-architecture.png" />
            <br/>
            <br/>
            As you can see, language plugins talk mostly through the GSF APIs
            to implement their features. GSF is in turn implemented in many cases
            on top of existing NetBeans APIs. In some cases, the abstraction on
            top of existing APIs (such as the Hyperlink API) is very thin. In other
            cases, such as for quickfixes, mark occurrences or semantic highlighting,
            GSF provides a lot of UI implementation under the hood on top of the
            existing APIs.  You might wonder why GSF should bother with features
            such as code completion and hyperlinking when the existing APIs are
            pretty complete. There are several reasons for this:
            <ul>
                <li>Simpler to learn from one place. The goal for GSF is to bring
                    language support of many languages in NetBeans up to the same depth
                    of support as we have for Java.  (See 
                    <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/EditorFeaturesChecklist">http://wiki.netbeans.org/EditorFeaturesChecklist</a>
                    for a document which tries to list all these features.)
                    If you have to go and hunt for various different NetBeans APIs 
                    (navigation, hyperlinking, highlighting, etc.) it's a lot harder 
                    to make sure you cover everything, and you in some cases have
                    to learn new concepts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    GSF can take advantage of synergy. For example, GSF knows how
                    to (a) parse your code, and (b) index your code, so it can hand
                    you an up to date parse tree when it's asking you to for example
                    compute the declaration location for an editor click. That makes
                    your job easier. As another example, because GSF implements both
                    your Hyperlink provider (Go To Declaration), and your code completion
                    documentation provider, it can register a tooltip which shows the
                    documentation for the symbol under the caret when you are
                    ctrl-hovering over that symbol. And so on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    GSF makes unit testing easier. This is another aspect of the synergy
                    point I brought up above. When you for example add a new 
                    "semantic highlighting" implementation, writing a unit test for it
                    is as simple as writing a simple function call - pass in a source
                    file, and a caret location. The GSF unit testing infrastructure
                    will do the rest: It will parse your file, pass it to your semantic
                    highlighting feature implementation, produce a nice "golden file"
                    pretty print of your highlighting (see the unit testing section
                    of this document for details), and diff that result with the recorded
                    golden file (or create it if it doesn't exist). Thus, to unit test,
                    just create new testcases in the form of a source file, run the test
                    once to create a golden file, look at the golden file to make sure
                    it looks correct, and from now on you have a regression test which
                    makes sure that your semantic highlighter always produces the same
                    highlights for this source file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    GSF supports embedding. Thus, if you for example implement a GSF
                    hints provider for your language, when your language is embedded in
                    some other files, your quickfixes continue to work; they get run,
                    the error offsets from your AST get translated back to embedding
                    appropriate offsets, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The bigger point though is that for nearly all editing actions, there is
            shared UI that should not be duplicated across modules. Things like
            color and font definitions for syntax highlighting, error messages,
            action names, keybindings, icons etc. should all be defined in one place
            such that periodic maintenance keeps everything in sync, and such that
            for example editor themes work across all intentional and unintentional 
            file types.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, for many actions, there is a LOT of code behind the scenes
            that is not language specific.  Take mark occurrences for example.
            The only language specific thing there is determining, for a given offset,
            what the other corresponding occurrences are in terms of editor offsets.
            Everything else: ensuring that the parse information is up to date,
            listening on caret changes, painting highlights for the occurrences,
            defining and implementing "goto previous occurrence" and "goto next occurrence",
            and so on, should all be implemented in just one shared place.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing which is not obvious from the diagram above is that clients
            are free to use NetBeans APIs directly. For example, in NetBeans 6.1,
            the HTML module uses GSF for parsing, navigator, embedding etc. - but
            it registers its own CompletionProvider using the NetBeans APIs
            instead of GSF's code completion handler interface. It is possible
            to combine GSF with for example Schliemann or a custom written
            editor kit or custom written data loaders. More details about this
            are found in the <a href="registration.html#UseCustomEditorKit">custom editor kit</a> section.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Lack of Extensibility</h2>
        <p>
            One of the key principles of GSF is to keep all UI in GSF. In the old days,
            each language support would define all its own logical editor types, color 
            definitions, and so on. That made it really tricky to provide editor themes,
            as well as keep things consistent. A literal string may have one color in one
            file type, and another color in another filetype.
        </p>
        <p>
            This has some implications for GSF:
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the Java module, one of the key APIs you get is the ability
                    to schedule a user task: run the parse tree on a Java file,
                    and then run a task over the parse tree. (This is
                    <code>JavaSource.runUserActionTask()</code>).
                    This lets modules create arbitrary features for Java - and this
                    is how the various Java modules (navigation, hints, etc)
                    operate.
                    <br/><br/>
                    GSF does not push this approach (it's actually there, through
                    the <code>SourceModel</code> class, but you're discouraged
                    from using it).
                    <br/><br/>
                    This facility is typically used to implement specific features.
                    And the GSF Way is to implement the feature INSIDE GSF, and expose
                    a lean feature API to other language clients. If it's a feature
                    needed for language A, chances are it's needed for language B
                    as well, and putting user <b>feature</b> code in language plugins
                    is the opposite approach of what GSF is trying to do.
                    <br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    GSF tries to make it really easy to describe UI. It provides this
                    through the 
                    <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/ElementKind.html">ElementKind</a>
                    enumeration class. When creating code completion items, or navigation
                    items, just reference one of the constants there, such as
                    ElementKind.METHOD, to create an item which will look like a method,
                    consistent across languages. This will provide an icon, a color,
                    a code completion sorting priority etc. None of these are language
                    specific, which is why GSF wants to provide the definitions, and
                    language clients just reference them through the enumeration name.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This of course may seem like a straightjacket - the types of code
                    elements that GSF can address are hardcoded!!
                    <br/><br/>
                    Once again, the philosophy here is that GSF is trying to address
                    a wide swath of languages, but perhaps not every single one. 
                    Rather than saying that say a Prolog language has a particular
                    code element that isn't provided by GSF today so Prolog should have
                    the option of adding it, I'd like to add new types to the ElementKind
                    enum. They can be added in every release without any backwards
                    compatibility problems. Chances are, if something is available in
                    one language, it's going to be needed by some other language as well.
                    Second, there's a pretty simple workaround - pick something SIMILAR.
                    In Ruby for example, I could have used the FIELD kind if there
                    wasn't an ATTRIBUTE kind.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Finally, there are backdoors. For example, the CompletionProposal
                    interface (implemented by code completion items) actually has
                    a <code>getIcon()</code> method, where you normally return null,
                    but you can override the icon there. This is how I return a 
                    Ruby specific icon for Ruby keywords in code completion (and
                    ditto for JavaScript). But overriding UI is the exception, not
                    the norm.
                    <br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    GSF lets client format the data shown in code completion items; 
                    there's the left hand side, the right hand side, as well as
                    different colors and attributes for parameter types, return types,
                    overridden methods, deprecated methods, etc.  Rather than
                    letting clients format HTML directly (which would for example
                    cause color definitions to get hardcoded into the clients),
                    GSF provides an HTML formatter to clients, and when they need
                    to produce HTML, they use logical formatter methods to emit
                    HTML. The actual color definitions etc. are therefore provided
                    by GSF and clients are a bit more high level.
                    <br/><br/>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Service Implementations</h2>
        <p>
            A language plugin basically registers a bunch of callbacks. These are invoked
            at appropriate times by the infrastructure.  There are two types of callbacks:
            <ol>
                <li>Service Implementations, such as lexing and parsing</li>
                <li>Feature Implementations, such as code completion and quickfixes</li>
            </ol>
            Service Implementations basically implement basic services that are used
            to drive other features. There service implementations are:
            <ul>
                <li>Lexing: Tokenize a document into syntactic elements</li>
                <li>Parsing: Parse a document into semantic structure</li>
                <li>Indexing: Given a parse result, store some information in a persistent
                (and quickly searchable) index</li>
            </ul>
            The infrastructure will call your services at the right times. For example,
            the lexer is asked to lex your document when it is opened in the editor.
            It is also asked to update the token hierarchy immediately as the document
            is edited. Similarly, the parser is called in a background thread shortly
            after the document has been edited, or immediately when the result is needed
            right away such as during code completion. And finally, the indexer is called
            when you leave a file (to keep the index up to date), or at startup for
            files that are new or have been updated outside the IDE.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Lexing</h3>
        <p>
            GSF uses the Lexer API in NetBeans directly. All GSF languages must provide
            a Lexer language. It must also be registered in the Editors mime folder.
            See the <a href="registration.html">Registration</a> section for more details.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Parsing</h3>
        <p>
            GSF provides a <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/Parser.html">parser</a> interface.
            You can register a parser, and GSF will call your parser when needed.  
        </p>
        <blockquote style="background-color: #ffdddd; color: black; padding: 20px; border: solid 1px black">
            NOTE: There is a new Parsing API underway. This will be something
            equivalent to the Lexer API, but applied to parsing. The plan is for GSF
            to remove its own Parser registration and interfaces and replace it with
            the standard Parser API. This will allow embedding and coordination
            not just among GSF-based languages, but for all languages that implement
            the parsing API (such as Java, and C/C++, which are not GSF based).

        <p>
            The Parser API basically just asks you to parse a given CharSequence,
            and return the result as your own subclass of the
            <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/ParserResult.html">ParserResult</a> interface.
            It is in your own parser result that you store your own AST reference.
            You will probably need it to implement most of the features.
            There is a separate document describing the <a href="parsing.html">parsing aspects</a>
            of GSF. (Eventually you'll also want to implement
            <a href="incremental-parsing.html">incremental parsing</a>.)
        </p>
        <h3>Indexing</h3>
        <p>
            Indexing lets you register a service which will extract information from your
            parse results, and store them in an index which can be queried quickly later.
            Your indexer will be called "at the right times" by the infrastructure:
            <ol>
                <li>At startup for all source files that are new or have changed since the 
                    last IDE session
                </li>
                <li>After a file has been edited, and closed/left</li>
                <li>Immediately if a file has been edited and somebody is trying to query the index
            </ol>
            
            This topic is described in a lot more detail in the separate 
            <a href="indexer.html">Indexing and Querying</a> document.
        </p>
        <h2>Feature Implementations</h2>
        
        The service implementations above aren't really useful in their own right,
        but they allow a number of features to be implemented. When implementing
        additional feature interfaces, you get handed your token hierarchy from
        your lexer, your parse tree and a handle to search the index populated
        by your indexer, which you can use to respond to the feature requests.
        
        <h3>Semantic Highlighting</h3>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            To implement semantic highlighting, you need to 
            <a href="registration.html">register</a> an implementation of the
            <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/SemanticAnalyzer.html">SemanticAnalyzer</a> interface.
            You will be given your own <code>ParserResult</code> object, and
            you need to return a <code>Map&lt;OffsetRange, Set&lt;ColoringAttributes&gt;&gt;</code>.
            So, you'll iterate your own AST, look for things to highlight, such as
            method definitions, parameters and unused variables, and for each node,
            look up its source offsets (start, end integer offsets in the document),
            and then place them in the document:
            <pre style="background: #ffffcc; color: black; border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px">    
    // Aha, this is an unused variable reference!
    int nodeStart = node.getStartOffset();
    int nodeEnd = node.getEndOffset();
    result.put(new OffsetRange(nodeStart, nodeEnd), ColoringAttribute.UNUSED_SET);
            </pre>
            Mark Occurrences is very similar to this. You implement the 
            <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/OccurrencesFinder.html">OccurrencesFinder</a> interface,
            where you return a Set&lt;OffsetRange&gt; for the symbols that should be
            highlighted as other occurrences of the symbol at the given offset.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Other Features</h3>
        <p>
            TODO: I plan to write some documents explaining how to do keystroke handling,
            formatting, declaration finding, code completion, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Registration</h2>
        <p>
            GSF services, such as the lexer, parser, and feature implementations,
            must all be registered with the GSF infrastructure. For details on
            how to do this, see the <a href="registration.html">Registration document</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Embedding</h2>
        <p>
            GSF supports language embedding - supporting nested languages, like 
            JavaScript and CSS support inside HTML files, Ruby support (and JavaScript
            and CSS support) inside ERb/RHTML files, and so on.
            The mechanism of how this works is described fully in the
            <a href="embedding.html">embedding document</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>GSF Diagnostic Tools</h2>
        <p>
            There is a separate module in the contrib repository, <code>gsf.tools</code>,
            which provides a number of tools in the <b>Tools | GSF Development</b> menu.
            Details are described in the <a href="gsf-tools.html">GSF Development Tools</a> document.
        </p>
        
        <a name="Classpath"/>
        <h2>Classpath</h2>
        GSF needs to integrated with the project system, in order to index source files at startup,
        in order to support project-wide operations like Open Type, and so on. Details about
        the project and classpath integration are discussed in more detail in the
        <a href="classpath.html">Classpath document</a>.
        
        <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
        <p>
            GSF makes it really easy to unit test your feature implementations.
            Details on how to do this is described in the <a href="unit-testing.html">unit 
            testing document</a>.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Implementation Issues/Limitations</h2>
        <p>
            I will describe the various GSF limitations here. For now, they are
            listed (in very brief form) in the following Wiki page:<br/>
            <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/GsfIssues">http://wiki.netbeans.org/GsfIssues</a>
            <br/>
        </p>
        
        <h2>TODO</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Describe the philosophy of the builtin ElementKind UI, icons, fonts etc. and
                    the general philosophy of pushing features INTO gsf rather than supporting
                    generic user task execution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Describe the modules, imported and exported APIs, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Document the GSF limitations
                </li>
                <li>Write documents for specific features, like code completion and keystroke handling</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
