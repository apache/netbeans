/** Registers an action to open an HTML (possibly with
 * {@link net.java.html.json.Model HTML for Java} integration). The essential
 * aspect is to create an HTML page and reference its location via {@link #url() } attribute.
 * The page may contain any JavaScript, but as we are Java developers, it is 
 * preferrable to rather use <a href="http://bits.netbeans.org">HTML for Java API</a>.
 * In such case the associated static method (which is annotated by this annotation) will be
 * called once the HTML page is loaded. One is expected to instantiate class generated 
 * by the {@link net.java.html.json.Model} annotation and call <code>applyBindings()</code>
 * on it. Here is an example: 
 * <p>
 * {@snippet file="org/netbeans/api/htmlui/UICntrl.java" region="controller"}

* The above would display a new action in Toolbar and in Menu that would, upon invocation,
 * open up a new component displaying the 
 * <code>ui.html</code> page. The page can use 
 * <a target="_blank" href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout.js</a> bindings like 
 * <code>&lt;input data-bind="textInput: text"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;</code> to reference 
 * properties defined by the {@link net.java.html.json.Model} annotation in the generated class
 * <code>UI</code>:
 * <p>
 * {@snippet file="org/netbeans/api/htmlui/dialog.html" region="org.netbeans.api.htmlui.dialog.html"}
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition to the above, there is a special support for influencing {@link org.openide.util.Utilities#actionsGlobalContext() 
 * action context} and thus turning on and off various actions shown in menu and toolbar. Just
 * define <code>{@link net.java.html.json.Property @Property}(name = "context", type = String.class, array = true)</code>
 * and put into it fully qualified names of classes you want to expose in the context. 
 * Those classes should be public and have public constructor that takes instance of the model
 * class returned from the annotated method (e.g. <code>UI</code> in the above example). The 
 * system will instantiate them appropriatelly and will make sure they are available in the action
 * context. If the interface also implements {@link Closeable}, its close method is invoked once
 * the instance is removed from the context to handle clean up.
