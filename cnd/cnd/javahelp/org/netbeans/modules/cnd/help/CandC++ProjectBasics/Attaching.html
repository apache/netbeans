<h2>Attaching the Debugger to a Running Process</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>
If you want to debug a program that is already running, you can
attach the debugger to the appropriate process.
</p>
<p>
You might want to attach the debugger to a running process under
the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>
To debug a running server without stopping or killing it
</li>
<li>
To debug a running GUI program without restarting it
</li>
<li>To debug a program that is looping indefinitely without
killing it
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To attach the debugger to a running process:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose Debug &gt; Attach Debugger or click the down arrow next
to the Debug Project toolbar button
<img src="../images/Debug_Main_Project.gif" alt="Debug Project button">&nbsp;
and choose Attach Debugger.
<p>The Attach dialog box opens displaying a list of all of your
currently active processes.
</p>
</li>
<li>Select the local host or a remote host from the Host drop-down list.
To add a new remote host, click Hosts and define the new host in the
Remote Host Settings dialog box.
</li>
<li>If you want to filter the list of processes, type the string
you want to match in the Filter text field.
</li>
<li>Select the process to which you want to attach the debugger.
</li>
<li>The executable associated with the process is automatically displayed in the
Executable text field.
</li>
<li>By default, the Project text field displays the name of the project.
If you want a different project associated with this executable, select a
project from the Project drop-down list. If you do not want the executable
associated with a project, select &lt;no project&gt;. </p>
<p>If you want a new project
created for the executable, select &lt;create new project&gt;.
If you create a new project for your executable, only the executable is stored
in the project properties. You need to set the other project properties by
right-clicking the project in the Projects window and choosing Project Properties.
</p>
</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
