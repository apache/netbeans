<!--
     Defines the properties to be validated. In a
     web application, a field would also correspond to a control on
     a HTML form. To validate the properties, the validator works through
     a JavaBean representation. The field element accepts these 
     attributes:

     property        The property on the JavaBean corresponding to this
                     field element.

     depends         The comma-delimited list of validators to apply against
                     this field. For the field to succeed, all the
                     validators must succeed.

     page            The JavaBean corresponding to this form may include
                     a page property. Only fields with a "page" attribute
                     value that is equal to or less than the page property
                     on the form JavaBean are processed. This is useful when
                     using a "wizard" approach to completing a large form,
                     to ensure that a page is not skipped.

     indexedListProperty
                     The "indexedListProperty" is the method name that will
                     return an array or a Collection used to retrieve the
                     list and then loop through the list performing the
                     validations for this field.

<!--
     Defines a custom message key to use when one of the
     validators for this field fails. Each validator has a default message
     property that is used when a corresponding field msg is not specified.
     Each validator applied to a field may have its own msg element.
     The msg element accepts these attributes.

      name        The name of the validator corresponding to this msg.
      
      bundle     The resource bundle name that the key should be resolved in.

      key         The key that will return the message template from a
                  resource bundle.

      resource    If set to "false", the key is taken to be a literal
                  value rather than a bundle key.

     Defines a replacement value to use with the
     message template for this validator or this field.
     The arg element accepts these attributes.

      name        The name of the validator corresponding to this msg.
      			  If not supplied, this argument will be used in the given 
      			  position for every validator.
      			  
      bundle     The resource bundle name that the key should be resolved in.      			  

      key         The key that will return the message template from a
                  resource bundle.

      resource    If set to "false", the key is taken to be a literal
                  value rather than a bundle key.
                  [true]

      position    The position of this replacement parameter in the message.
                  For example, position="0" will set the first argument.

             N.B. Since 1.2.0 position is ignored for 'default' arguments
                  (i.e. those with no 'name' supplied) - it is calculated
                  automatically from the order the arguments are added in.
                  For 'overriden' arguments (i.e. those with a 'name')
                  it is optional. If 'position' is not supplied it will
                  use the position of the 'default' argument it follows.

     The "var" element can set parameters that a field may need to pass to
     one of its validators, such as the minimum and maximum values in a
     range validation. These parameters may also be referenced by one of the
     arg? elements using a shell syntax: ${var:var-name}.

     N.B. resource ='true' indicates that the var-value is a resource key,
          with the option to specify the bundle name. Validator doesn't do
          anything itself with these values. Down-stream systems need
          to resolve resource values.
