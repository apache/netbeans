  <p>
  The Highlighting SPI is a new way of influencing how text in an editor component
  is rendered. The editor framework in Netbeans is an extension of the Swing Text SPI
  framework and as such it uses things like <code>Element</code>s and <code>View</code>s
  to render a <code>Document</code> on a screen.
  </p>

  <p>
  Since the editor framework is primarily designed to support various different
  types of files in the IDE it has to give module a chance to participate in documents
  rendering. Modules providing support for different languages usually need to influence
  colors and fonts of different parts of a source file depending on what code it
  contains (i.e. syntax coloring) or what other information the module needs presenting
  to a user (e.g. text annotations, hyperlinking, etc.). This all and more can
  be achieved by using the Highlighting SPI.
  </p>


  <h3>Key parts of the SPI</h3>
  
  <p>
  The very basic idea behind the SPI is to render a document as a sandwich of
  independent layers, which will say what colors and font should be used for rendering
  particular parts of the document. These parts of the document together with their
  <i>rendering attributes</i> (i.e. colors or font) are called <i>highlighted areas</i>
  or <i>highlights</i>. Each layer can provide as many non-overlapping highlights
  as it likes and each module can provide as many layers as it needs. The implementation
  behind the SPI will collect all layers registered for a particular document type
  (i.e. mime type), ask each of them for its highlights, merge those highlights
  together and finally send them to the draw engine, which will render the document.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The whole SPI is organized around the
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/spi/editor/highlighting/HighlightsLayer.html">HighlightsLayer</a></code>
  class, which is the ultimate thing that modules need to implement in order to provide
  a list of highlights for a document. The <code>HighlightsLayer</code>s are created
  by <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/spi/editor/highlighting/HighlightsLayerFactory.html">HighlightsLayerFactory</a></code>,
  which should be registered in <code>MimeLookup</code> under the mime-type of a document
  that the layer should be used for. All layers registered for one type of a document
  are ordedred according to the
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/spi/editor/highlighting/ZOrder.html">ZOrder</a></code>
  they provide. Besides of <code>ZOrder</code> the layers provide additional information
  about nature of highlights they maintain.
  </p>

  <p>
  The <code>HighlightsLayer</code> class implements
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/spi/editor/highlighting/HighlightsContainer.html">HighlightsContainer</a></code>
  interface, which is the fundamental part of the SPI.
  The <code>HighlightsContainer</code> interface allows to get a list of highlighs
  and to listen on changes in highlights that it contains.
  Besides of <code>HighlightsLayer</code> there are two other implementations of
  this interface and they are
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/spi/editor/highlighting/support/OffsetsBag.html">OffsetsBag</a></code>
  and
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/spi/editor/highlighting/support/PositionsBag.html">PositionsBag</a></code>.
  Both <code>OffsetsBag</code> and <code>PositionsBag</code> classes allow adding
  and removing highlights dynamically. The highlights can be added either one-by-one
  or in chunks; each change is reported to listeners.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>HighlightsLayer registration</h3>
  
  <p>
  The registration of <code>HighlightsLayer</code>s has to be done through an
  instance of the <code>HighlightsLayerFactory</code> class. The factory should
  be registered in <code>MimeLookup</code> under the mime-type of documents, which
  the <code>HighlightsLayer</code> should be used for. For example, if a module
  wants to provide <code>HighlightsLayer</code> for <code>text/x-something</code> documents
  it should implement its own <code>HighlightsLayerFactory</code> (e.g.
  <code>org.some.module.HLFactory</code> class) and register it in <code>MimeLookup</code>
  using its XML layer as it is shown on the example below.
  </p>
  
  <pre>
&lt;folder name="Editors"&gt;
  &lt;folder name="text"&gt;
    &lt;folder name="x-something"&gt;
        &lt;file name="org-some-module-HLFactory.instance" /&gt;
    &lt;/folder&gt;
  &lt;/folder&gt;
&lt;/folder&gt;
  </pre>

  <p>
  The <code>HLFactory</code> class will simply return a new instance of
  the module's implementation of the <code>HighlightsLayer</code> class from its
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/spi/editor/highlighting/HighlightsLayerFactory.html#createLayers-org.netbeans.spi.editor.highlighting.HighlightsLayerFactory.Context-">createLayers</a></code>
  method. The parameter of the <code>createLayers</code> method provides access to
  a <code>JTextComponent</code> and its <code>Document</code>, which the layer
  is being created for. The method can create and return multiple <code>HighlightsLayer</code>s.
  </p>

  
  <h3>HighlightsLayer lifecycle</h3>
  
  <p>The lifecycle of <code>HighlightsLayer</code>s is tied to the lifecycle of
  <code>Document</code>. The infrastructure creates new instances of layers by calling
  registered <code>HighlightsLayerFactory</code> objects every time it needs to
  visualize a new <code>Document</code>. The layers created for one <code>Document</code>
  are not cached or resused in any way. This means that the layers themselvs do not have to take
  care about a potential change of a <code>Document</code> instance in
  <code>JTextComponent</code>. The infrastructre will always create a new set of
  layers if the <code>Document</code> instance changes. Therefore the layers can
  simply hold their instance of <code>JTextComponent</code> and/or <code>Document</code>
  and treat them as invariants.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Locking and <code>Document</code> changes</h3>
  
  <p>
  The basics of the locking and events model of Swing documents is
  described in the javadoc of the
  <a href="@JDK@/javax/swing/text/AbstractDocument.html">javax.swing.text.AbstractDocument</a>
  class. Netbeans documents use the same patterns and so does the Highlighting SPI,
  because of its tight relation to documents. The fundamentals of the Swing documents
  locking model are that any changes to a document are done under the
  document's write lock, the document's listeners are notified synchronously on the
  mutating thread and have full read access to the document, but can't modify it.
  </p>

  <p>
  The main functionality of the Highlighting SPI is to maintain highlights
  of certain areas of a document. These highlights are specified as a triple of
  starting offset, ending offset and a set of attributes. The offsets are usually passed
  in and out accross the SPI boundaries in form of <code>int</code>s and even though
  some implementations (e.g. <code>PositionsBag</code>) use
  <code><a href="@JDK@/javax/swing/text/Position.html">Position</a></code>s
  the esential rule is that any calls in and out from the SPI have to be made
  under the document's read lock. Let's have a look on a few examples demonstrating
  what this means.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
    Any calls from the infrastructure to <code>HighlightsLayer.getHighlights()</code>
    have to be carried on under the read lock of the document, which the <code>HighlightsLayer</code>
    was created for.
    </li>
    <li>
    When <code>HighlightsLayer</code> needs to notify its listeneres that some
    of its highlights have changed all the events have to be fired under the
    layer's document's read lock. Obviously, the listeners are not allowed to
    modify the document from the event notification methods.
    </li>
    <li>
    Any calls to <code>OffsetsBag</code> or <code>PositionsBag</code> that modify
    their content have to be done under the read lock of the document, which the bag
    was created for. Both bags makes all the
    changes synchronously on the caller's thread and this even includes firing
    notification events. Therefore all events fired from <code>OffsetsBag</code>
    or <code>PositionsBag</code>
    will be fired under the document's read lock if the mutating thread holds the
    read lock.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  The Highlighting SPI does not use any special threads and any processing it
  does is always done on the caller's thread. This means that the above described
  constraints hardly cause any limitation for practical use. The majority of
  things happening around a document are done from within
  <code><a href="@JDK@/javax/swing/event/DocumentListener.html">DocumentListener</a></code>s,
  which hold the document's read lock anyway.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The Highlighting SPI is generally thread-safe meaning that any implementation
  behind the SPI can be used simultaneously from multiple threads if not stated
  otherwise. This doesn't change in any way the rule of acquiring a read lock
  before calling the SPI. Swing documents generally allow access for multiple
  readers that can run concurrently.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Z-order</h3>
  <p>
  Since there can be multiple layers suplying highlights for one document and the
  highlights can generally overlap it is important to sort the layers according
  to their Z-order. For this purpose each layer has to supply an appropriate
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-lib2@/org/netbeans/spi/editor/highlighting/ZOrder.html">ZOrder</a></code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <code>ZOrder</code> maintains a position of a layer
  relatively to other layers as a simple integer number. The higher the number
  the higher (more visible) the layer is in the z-order hierarchy.
  Instances of the <code>ZOrder</code> class are immutable making it
  impossible to dynamically change a position of a layer in the z-order stack
  created for a document. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The <code>ZOrder</code> class contains several predefined constants,
  which can be used as well-known positions. These constants are called z-order
  racks and are meant to be used as a starting point for positioning a layer. An
  exact z-order can then be specified by choosing an integer position of the layer
  within a rack. The racks are listed below in their respective z-order. 
  </p>
  
  <ul>
      <li><code>TOP_RACK</code> - the top most rack</li>
      <li>
        <code>SHOW_OFF_RACK</code> - layers providing short-lived highlights that
        can temporarily override highlights from other layers. An example can be
        text selection or text search layers.
      </li>
      <li><code>DEFAULT_RACK</code> - the rack for general layers</li>
      <li><code>CARET_RACK</code> - layers that highlight a caret</li>
      <li>
        <code>SYNTAX_RACK</code> - layers providing syntax or semantic
        highlighting of text</li>
      <li><code>BOTOM_RACK</code> - the bottom rack</li>
  </ul>
  
 <!--
    - different types of layers - block highlights vs. text highlights, highlights altering metrics
  -->

  
  <h3>Using <code>AttributeSet</code></h3>
  <p>
  The Highlighting SPI uses <code>javax.swing.text.AttributeSet</code> to define
  attributes for particular highlights. These attributes can be anything,
  which the editor's drawing engine understands and can render. Usually the
  attribute names are constants from <code>javax.swing.StyleConstants</code> or
  <code>org.netbeans.api.editor.settings.EditorStyleConstants</code>. The values
  depend on the meaning of each particular attribute, but they usually are instances
  of <code>java.awt.Color</code>, <code>java.lang.Integer</code>, <code>Boolean.TRUE</code>
  or <code>Boolean.FALSE</code> and similar.
  </p>

  <p>
  Since there can be more highlighting layers participating on one document and
  they can provide highlights that overlap the infrastructure will merge attributes
  from all <code>AttributeSet</code>s provided for areas with overlapping highlights.
  The merging is done in the order defined by <code>ZOrder</code>s of the participating
  layers, which means that if two layers provide an attribute with the same name
  then the merged <code>AttributeSet</code> will contain the attribute from the
  layer, which is placed higher in the z-order hierarchy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  There are two important rules for using <code>AttributeSet</code>s, which should
  be carefully followed by all highlighting layer implementations. Violating these
  rules may potentialy break the rendering of a document or may cause performance
  problems.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
      <li><b>Immutability</b> - All instances of <code>AttributeSet</code>s should
      always be treated as immutable objects. Once you create an <code>AttibuteSet</code>
      and use it for a highlight you should not modify it. Your modification is
      most likely to be ignored or can have unpredictable results.
      </li>
      <li><b>One instance only</b> - There can be thousands of highlights supplied
      by layers for one document and a lot of them will be the same (e.g. all
      keywords in a java document are highlighted with the same color and font).
      It would be unreasonable to create a new <code>AttributeSet</code> for
      each of those highlights when all of them would in fact be the same. Instead
      you should always create one instance of <code>AttributeSet</code> and share
      it among all highlights that render the same text category (e.g. token or
      token category, etc.).
      </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  The <code>AttributeSet</code>s used for highlighting are often created by calling
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-settings@/org/netbeans/api/editor/settings/FontColorSettings.html">FontColorSettings</a></code>
  and it is a responsibility of this class to prevent excesive creation of
  <code>AttributeSet</code>s it provides. However, if your highlighting layer creates
  its own <code>AttributeSet</code>s they should always be cached and reused. You can
  use methods from the
  <code><a href="@org-netbeans-modules-editor-settings@/org/netbeans/api/editor/settings/AttributesUtilities.html">AttributesUtilities</a></code>
  class for creating immutable <code>AttributeSet</code>s.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3><a name="usecases">Use cases</a></h3>
  
  <h4>Use case 1. - Caret selection</h4>

  <p>
  The Netbeans editor as any other modern editor allows selecting blocks of text
  and highlighting them to a user for easier identification. We call this functionality
  caret selection services and it includes things as simple as marking a block of text
  that the user selected for copy/paste operation or highlighting a line where
  the caret is placed to more complex ones such as highlighting occurences of a text
  that the user search for using the 'Find dialog', etc.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  This functionality usually only needs to create one highlight and update it
  depending on the caret movements/selection notified from <code>JTextComponent</code>.
  The more complex cases may need to create several highlights (e.g. to show the
  text being searched for). Generally, the highlights are created independently on the
  text changes in the document itself (e.g. the caret move or searching for a text).
  However, they have to survive editing the document (e.g. the highlighted occurences
  of the searched text have to remain highlighted when other parts of the document
  are edited).
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The caret selection highlights are generally short-lived and have higher importance
  than other highlights (e.g. syntax or semantic coloring). They usually change
  the background color to highlight the selection, but also retain as much of
  a visual appearance of the highlighted text as possible.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Use case 2. - Syntax highlighting</h4>
  
  <p>
  This type of a document coloring shows 'words' or characters in different colors
  to indicate their meaning in the structure of the text document. This is very
  popular with highly structured documents such as source code files, scripts, 
  SGML-like documents, etc. It's usually not used for plain text documents containing
  text in a human language.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Syntax highlighting in Netbeans editor is based on a lexical analysis done by
  lexer plug-ins registered for various types of documents. The lexers are written
  using the APIs provided by the <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/projects/lexer/index.html">Lexer module</a>.
  During the lexical analysis text gets split into tokens of different types and
  categories. Each token type or category can have defined its own coloring information
  such as font and foreground and background colors, etc. Tokens know their position
  in text (i.e. offset and length), which information can then be used for creating
  highlights.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Decoupling the lexers
  and making them pluggable lets the syntax highlighting be very flexible. A single
  layer based on the Lexer API can colorify all sorts of documents providing that
  there is a lexer registered for each type of a document.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Generally a syntax analysis is very fast and syntax highlighting immediately
  reflects changes done in text. The syntax highlighting layer is usually at
  the bottom of the hierarchy of highlighting layers.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Use case 3. - Semantic highlighting</h4>
  
  <p>
  In fact semantic coloring regardless of the language it is provided for is
  very similar to syntax coloring. Words or groups of characters are highlighted
  depending on their meaning in the text. The difference is in the amount of
  information that is needed to make this type of coloring meaningful. While with
  syntax coloring all the information needed is in the text itself in semantic
  coloring parts of text can be colored depending on information found in a
  completely different document (e.g. in another source file, library, project, etc.).
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Semantic highlighting is highly dependent on the type of a document and therefore
  is usually provided on case-by-case basis and only for the most important types
  of documents (i.e. those most frequenty used such as java files in Netbeans). Also,
  semantic coloring is generally not very fast, because of the amount of information
  that is sometimes needed to gather before a document can be colored. Therefore,
  while all the effort is made to make semantic coloring reflect text changes as
  soon as possible, it is generally done asynchronously outside of the documents
  event model and highlights are created as soon as they are available. The tokens
  created during the semantic analysis always contain token's position within
  the text in some form (i.e. either offset or <code>Position</code>). If <code>Position</code>s
  are available they should be accepted and re-used by the Highlighting SPI.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Use case 4. - Embedded languages</h4>

  <p>
  An embedded language is a language of a part of a document that is different
  than the main language of the document. An example can be a java scriplet in
  a JSP page or JavaScript in an HTML document. The main language of a JSP page
  is 'text/x-jsp' and the emebedded language in the case of a java scriplet is
  'text/x-java'. For the HTML document the main language is 'text/html' and if
  a JavaScript part is included in the document the 'text/x-javascript' is the
  embedded language.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The language embedding is supported by Lexer API and therefore there is no
  problem with supporting it for syntax coloring. For semantic coloring all the
  work lies on the highlighting layers providing semantic coloring support for
  a particular language. These layers have to be prepared to provide highlights
  for parts of a document, which does not contain text in the language they support,
  but which contains some embedded parts in that language. The Highlighting
  infrastructure will scan the document for all languages it contains and then
  it will create appropriate highlighting layers. The layers can be added dynamically
  as user inserts parts of text in a new language. The layers, however, may not be
  removed immediately when the last part of text in a language they suppor is removed.
  Therefore the layers should be prepared to provide no highlights if there is
  no text they recognize.
  </p>
  
  <h4><a name="usecase5">Use case 5. - Filtering layers used for JTextComponent</a></h4>
  
  <p>
  In certain situations <code>JTextComponent</code> or <code>JEditorPane</code>
  are used for other purposes than editing. For example debugger may want to show
  <code>JEditorPane</code> for adding a new watch, where a user could write a piece
  of java code that should evaluated. This pane should use basically the same layers
  so that the entered code looks like properly colored and formatted java code.
  However, it is not desirable to use exactly the same layers as for an ordinary
  java editor, because some highlightings have a little value in this context or
  could even be disturbing. There is no point in highlighting the row with the caret,
  because watches are essentially one-line expressions. There is also a little point
  in showing text-search related highlights, because hardly anybody will use text
  search in these simple expressions anyway. On the other hand it makes sense to
  highlight selected text if user selects some.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  There can be a whole range of usecases where modules need to show an editor
  pane, but do not want to use a particular set of highlighting layers, which are
  registered for the mime type of text that the module is trying to display and
  which would normally be used for an ordinary editor pane. These usecases are
  very specific for each module and its way of implementing some features.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The editor insfrastructure supports this usecase through allowing modules to
  set special properties on the editor pane that they want to use for displaying text.
  The properties are called <code>HighlightsLayerIncludes</code> and <code>HighlightsLayerExcludes</code>.
  The value of those properties can be <code>String</code> or <code>String []</code>
  of regular expressions that will be used for finding the matching layers by evaluating
  each regular expression against the layer's type id. The exact interpretation of those
  two properties is described below.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
      <li>
      <code>HighlightsLayerIncludes</code> - Defines the set of layers that
      <b>will</b> be used for rendering text in an editor pane that defines this property.
      Every layer, which type Id matches at least one of the regular expressions
      defined by this property, will be <b>included</b> for rendering. The default value 
      is <code>null</code>, which means that all registered layers will be used.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>HighlightsLayerExcludes</code> - Defines the set of layers that
      <b>will not</b> be used for rendering. Every layer, which type Id matches
      at least one of the regular expressions defined by this property, will be
      <b>excluded</b> from rendering. The default value is <code>null</code>,
      which means that no layer will be excluded.
      </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  The filters defined by those two properties are used in the same order as they
  were listed above. That is the includes are used first and whatever layers they
  includ are then filtered by the excludes filter. The result is then used for
  rendering text in an editor component, which defined those properties.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The example below shows how to disable the caret row highlighting layer
  on <code>JEditorPane</code>.
  </p>
  
  <pre>
  JEditorPane pane = new JEditorPane();
  pane.putClientProperty(
    "HighlightsLayerExcludes", 
    "^org\\.netbeans\\.modules\\.editor\\.lib2\\.highlighting\\.CaretRowHighlighting$"
  );
  </pre>
  
  
  <h4>Other usecases</h4>
  
  <p>
  The main usecases described above are certainly not the only usecases of the
  Highlighting SPI. In general the SPI can be used for binding any type of
  information to parts of text in a document. While this information should have
  limited size to keep a good performance of Netbeans editor it can be pretty much
  anything. Information provided in highlights is currently used only by the editor's
  drawing engine, which provides a limited set of features useful mostly for
  rendering text. Some other uses could be for example text annotations, hyperlinking,
  showing icons in text, etc.
