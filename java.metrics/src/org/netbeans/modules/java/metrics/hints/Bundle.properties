# Method to complex
DN_MethodTooComplex=Method is too complex
DESC_MethodTooComplex=The inspection reports method, whose <b>Cyclomatic Complexity</b> \
    exceeds a configurable value. The <i>Cyclomatic Complexity</i> measures a number \
    of potential branching points (or cycles) in a method. It is believed that methods \
    with high cyclomatic complexity usually do too much and should be split to several, \
    more focused, methods. Such complex methods are also prone to code duplication between \
    their execution paths and are hard to sustain. Usually it is recommended that cyclomatic \
    complexity of a method is 5 or below; less than 10 may be also acceptable for more elaborate \
    algorithms. 

# Too deep nesting
DN_MethodTooDeepNesting=Too deep nesting
DESC_MethodTooDeepNesting=Reports methods whose bodies contain statements nested <i>too deep</i>. \
    Such methods are less readable, contain indent space and allow less \
    screen space for code reading. Methods can be often refactored and split to \
    improve code readability.

# Method too long - lines or statements
DN_MethodTooLong=Method body is too long
DESC_MethodTooLong=Reports methods, which have too long body. Longer methods require scrolling back \
    and forth, and typically can be refactored into several methods called from a mediating method. \
    Splitting a long method into several named pieces may also help code reuse. Some coding practices even \
    demand that a method should fit a screen size, so it can be easily scanned and understood by the developer.

# Method throws too many exception
DN_MethodTooManyExceptions=Method or constructor declares too many exceptions
DESC_MethodTooManyExceptions=Reports methods which declare many exceptions in their <b>throws</b> clause. Method \
    that produce a large number of exception types are hard to use, as the caller must handle all the outcomes \
    or complicate its own declaration with exceptions. The error handling code grows more complex. \
    <p/>The inspection also processes constructors.
OPTNAME_MethodExceptionsLimit=Allowed exception count
OPTDESC_MethodExceptionsLimit=

# Method declares too may parameters
DN_MethodTooManyParameters=Method declares too many parameters
DESC_MethodTooManyParameters=Reports method that take too many parameters. Methods with large number of parameters \
    indicate a bad design. It's likely that yet more parameters will be added in the future, so the parameters \
    should be grouped into a Command Object, improving maintenance costs. Alternatively, the method could be refactored \
    into several methods, each doing part of the task and requiring less parameters at input.
OPTNAME_MethodParametersLimit=Allowed parameter count
OPTDESC_MethodParametersLimit=

DN_CtorTooManyParameters=Constructor declares too many parameters
DESC_CtorTooManyParameters=Reports constructor that take too many parameters. Constructors typically take more parameters \
    than a regular method, especially when initializing a large object.<p/>Large number of parameters \
    indicate a bad design. It's likely that yet more parameters will be added in the future, so creational patterns like \
    Builder should be considered.

# Method with mulitple return statements
DN_MethodMultipleReturns=Method with multiple return points
DESC_MethodMultipleReturns=Reports methods, which exit at multiple places using <b>return</b> statement. \
    Such methods may be confusing and are \
    harder to refactor. The inspection can ignore conditional <b>guard returns</b> - a <b>return</b> statement, which \
    is the sole statement in an <b>if</b> branch. Optionally, all <b>equals</b> methods can be ignored, as contents of \
    <b>equals</b> is traditionally generated using early returns on type or value mismatch.

# Method with multiple negations
DN_MethodMultipleNegations=Method with multiple negations
DESC_MethodMultipleNegations=Methods with multiple negated expressions (unary <b>!</b> or <b>!=</b>) are said to confuse \
    readers, true (non-negated) expressions are considered easier to read and understand. Consider to change the logic to \
    use true instead of false values.

DN_MethodCoupled=Too coupled method
DESC_MethodCoupled=Reports methods which are too coupled - that refer to too many \
    other types. Methods that \
    refer to large number of types are <i>fragile</i>: they tend to fail or require refactoring \
    if the referenced type(s) change. It is also more difficult to move the method which has \
    many dependencies to another module. <p/>References \
    to the method class' itself and its superclasses are ignored. With <i>Ignore dependencies on \
     Java Platform</i>, references to <code>java.**</code> and <code>javax.**</code> classes \
    are also ignored.

DN_ClassAnonymousTooComplex=Anonymous class is too complex
DESC_ClassAnonymousTooComplex=Reports anonymous classes, whose cyclomatic complexity exceeds the configured limit. \

    less responsibilities and lower complexity than a regular class

DN_ComplexArithmeticExpression=Arithmetic expression too complex
DESC_ComplexArithmeticExpression=Reports arithmetic expressions, which include more than the defined number of operations. \
    Expression with many operands are harder to read and often could be split into several assignment statements to interim \
    result variables.

DN_ClassConstructorCount=Class has too many constructors
DESC_ClassConstructorCount=Reports classes which define too many constructors. 

DN_AnonClassMethodCount=Anonymous class has too many methods
DESC_AnonClassMethodCount=Reports anonymous class with many methods. Anonymous classes typically implement a very simple \
    interface, and should be very simple. It is recommended to create at least named local class, if the anonymous \
    class' complexity grows.

DN_ClassMethodCount=Class has too many methods
DESC_ClassMethodCount=Reports class, which contains too many methods. The options allows to ignore simple bean property \
    accessors - lazy getters, or setters which fire change events are not considered 'simple'. Implementations of superclass \
    (not implementation of interface methods) abstract methods can be also ignored.

DN_ClassFieldCount=Class has too many fields
DESC_ClassFieldCount=Reports a class which holds too many fields. The state kept by the class is too large and it should \

    reduce the overall class complexity.
