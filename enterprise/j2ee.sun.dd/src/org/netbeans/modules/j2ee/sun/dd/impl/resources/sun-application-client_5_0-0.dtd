The message-layer entity is used to define the value of the

Used in: message-security-binding
-->
<!ENTITY % message-layer    "(SOAP)">

<!--
The message-security-binding element is used to customize the
webservice-endpoint or port to provider binding; either by binding the
webservice-endpoint or port to a specific provider or by providing a
definition of the message security requirements to be enforced by the
provider.

These elements are typically NOT created as a result of the
deployment of an application. They need only be created when the
deployer or system administrator chooses to customize the 
webservice-endpoint or port to provider binding.

The optional (repeating) message-security sub-element is used 
to accomplish the latter; in which case the specified 
message-security requirements override any defined with the
provider.

The auth-layer attribute identifies the message layer at which the
message-security requirements are to be enforced.

The optional provider-id attribute identifies the provider-config 
and thus the authentication provider that is to be used to satisfy 
the application specific message security requirements. If a value for 
the provider-id attribute is not specified, and a default
provider is defined for the message layer, then it is used. 
if a value for the provider-id attribute is not specified, and a
default provider is not defined at the layer, the authentication
requirements defined in the message-security-binding are not
enforced.

<!--
The message-security element describes message security requirements
that pertain to the request and response messages of the containing 
endpoint, or port

When contained within a webservice-endpoint this element describes 
the message security requirements that pertain to the request and 
response messages of the containing endpoint. When contained within a 
port-info of a service-ref this element describes the message security
requirements of the port of the referenced service.

The one or more contained message elements define the methods or operations
of the containing application, endpoint, or referenced service to which 
the message security requirements apply.

Multiple message-security elements occur within a containing
element when it is necessary to define different message
security requirements for different messages within the encompassing
context. In such circumstances, the peer elements should not overlap
in the messages they pertain to. If there is any overlap in the
identified messages, no message security requirements apply to
the messages for which more than one message-security element apply.

Also, no message security requirements apply to any messages of
the encompassing context that are not identified by a message element. 
 
Default:
Used in: webservice-endpoint, and port-info
-->
<!ELEMENT message-security ( message+, request-protection?, response-protection? )>

<!--
The message element identifies the methods or operations to which
the message security requirements apply.

The identified methods or operations are methods or operations of
the resource identified by the context in which the message-security
element is defined (e.g. the the resource identified by the
service-qname of the containing webservice-endpoint or service-ref).

An empty message element indicates that the security requirements
apply to all the methods or operations of the identified resource.

When operation-name is specified, the security
requirements defined in the containing message-security 
element apply to all the operations of the endpoint 
with the specified (and potentially overloaded) operation name.

Default: 
Used in: message-security
-->
<!ELEMENT message ( java-method? | operation-name? )>

<!--
The java-method element is used to identify a method (or methods
in the case of an overloaded method-name) of the java class 
indicated by the context in which the java-method is contained.

The operation-name element is used to identify the WSDL name of an
operation of a web service.

Default: 
Used in: message

<!ELEMENT operation-name ( #PCDATA )>

<!--
The request-protection element describes the authentication requirements
that apply to a request.

The auth-source attribute defines a requirement for message layer
sender authentication (e.g. username password) or content authentication 
(e.g. digital signature).

The auth-recipient attribute defines a requirement for message
layer authentication of the reciever of a message to its sender (e.g. by 
XML encryption).

The before-content attribute value indicates that recipient
authentication (e.g. encryption) is to occur before any 
content authentication (e.g. encrypt then sign) with respect
to the target of the containing auth-policy.

An absent request-protection element is the recommended shorthand
for a request-protection element with unspecified values for both the
auth-source and auth-recipient attributes.

Default: 
Used in: message-security

 * Expected evolution to support partial message protection:
 *
 * request-protection ( content-auth-policy* )
 *
 * If the request-protection element contains one or more
 * content-auth-policy sub-elements, they define the authentication
 * requirements to be applied to the identified request content. If multiple
 * content-auth-policy sub-elements are defined, a request sender must
 * satisfy the requirements independently, and in the specified order.  
 *
 * The content-auth-policy element would be used to associate authentication
 * requirements with the parts of the request or response object identified
 * by the contained method-params or part-name-list sub-elements.
 *
 * The content-auth-policy element would be defined as follows:

 * content-auth-policy ( method-params | part-name-list )

The java-web-start-access element contains all information relevant to Java

The context-root subelement allows the developer to specify what context root
will be used for addressing the app client via Java Web Start.  If absent, the
app server uses a default context root value.

The eligible subelement allows the developer to control whether this app client
should allow Java Web Start access.  If this value is false, then Java Web Start
will never be allowed access.  Default: true.

The vendor subelement allows the developer to specify the vendor name that Java
