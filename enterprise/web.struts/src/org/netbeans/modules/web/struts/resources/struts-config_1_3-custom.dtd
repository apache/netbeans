                     specified, else not valid.

     type            Fully qualified Java class name of the Action subclass
                     [org.apache.struts.action.Action] that will process requests
                     for this action mapping. Not valid if either the "forward"
                     or "include" attribute is specified.  Exactly one of
                     "forward", "include", or "type" must be specified.

     unknown         Set to "true" if this object should be configured as the
                     default action mapping for this module. If a request does not
                     match another object, it will be passed to the ActionMapping
                     object with unknown set to "true". Only one ActionMapping
                     can be marked as "unknown" within a module.

     validate        Set to "true" if the validate method of the ActionForm bean
                     should be called prior to calling the Action object for this
                     action mapping, or set to "false" if you do not want the
                     validate method called.

<!-- The "controller" element describes the ControllerConfig bean
     [org.apache.struts.config.ControllerConfig] that encapsulates
     a module's runtime configuration. The following
     attributes are defined:

     bufferSize      The size of the input buffer used when processing
                     file uploads.
                     [4096]

     className       Fully qualified Java class name of the
                     ControllerConfig subclass for this controller object.
                     If specified, the object must be a subclass of the

     command         Name of the command to execute to process a request.
                     [servlet-standard]

     contentType     Default content type (and optional character encoding) to
                     be set on each response. May be overridden by the Action,
                     JSP, or other resource to which the request is forwarded.
                     ["text/html"]

     forwardPattern  Replacement pattern defining how the "path" attribute of a
                     <forward> element is mapped to a context-relative URL when
                     it starts with a slash (and when the contextRelative
                     property is false). This value may consist of any
                     combination of the following:
                     - "$M" - Replaced by the module prefix of this module
                     - "$P" - Replaced by the "path" attribute of the  selected

                     Silently swallowed, reserved for future use

                     forwards.  Since Struts 1.1.  ["$M$P"]

     inputForward    Set to "true" if you want the "input" attribute of
                     <action> elements to be the name of a local or global
                     ActionForward, which will then be used to calculate the
                     ultimate URL. Set to "false" (the default) to treat the
                     "input" parameter of <action> elements as a
                     module-relative path to the resource
                     to be used as the input form. Since Struts 1.1.
                     [false]

                     [true]

     maxFileSize     The maximum size (in bytes) of a file to be accepted as a
                     file upload.  Can be expressed as a number followed by a
                     "K", "M", or "G", which are interpreted to mean kilobytes,
                     megabytes, or gigabytes, respectively.
                     ["250M"]

     memFileSize     The maximum size (in bytes) of a file whose contents will
                     be retained in memory after uploading. Files larger than
                     this threshold will be written to some alternative storage
                     medium, typically a hard disk. Can be expressed as a number
                     followed by a "K", "M", or "G", which are interpreted to
                     mean kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes, respectively.
                     ["256K"]

     multipartClass  The fully qualified Java class name of the multipart
                     request handler class to be used with this module.
                     ["org.apache.struts.upload.CommonsMultipartRequestHandler"]

     nocache         Set to "true" if you want the controller to add HTTP
                     headers for defeating caching to every response from
                     this module.  [false]

     pagePattern     Replacement pattern defining how the "page" attribute of
                     custom tags using it is mapped to a context-relative URL
                     of the corresponding resource.  This value may consist of
                     any combination of the following:
                     - "$M" - Replaced by the module prefix of this module
                     - "$P" - Replaced by the value of the "page" attribute

                     - "$x" - (Where "x" is any character not defined above)
                              Silently swallowed, reserved for future use
                     If not specified, the default forwardPattern is
                     "$M$P", which is consistent with previous hard coded
                     behavior of URL evaluation for "page" attributes.

     can be passed whatever other properties may be required to configure the
     object without changing how the struts-config is parsed.

    Since Struts 1.3, an alternate syntax is supported.  By using
    the "key" attribute instead of the "property" attribute, you can set 
    arbitrary string properties on the Config object which is populated
    based on the containing element.   NOTE: the "key" attribute is NOT
	supported for <set-property> inside a <plug-in> element.
