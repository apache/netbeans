        Creates a class which allows you to manage the module's lifecycle
        (installation and uninstallation).
        <strong>Remember that an installer is optional and often not needed at all.</strong>
        Either a <code>ModuleInstall</code> is created if this module is
        a regular NetBeans module, or a <code>BundleActivator</code> is created
        if you have chosen that the module project generates OSGi bundle.
