       This overview describes the windows and tools that are central to performing your daily C,
      C++, or Fortran development tasks in the IDE. For information about the IDE workflow, see <a

    <h3>
       Projects Window<a name="Projects"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The <a href="ProjectsWindow.html">Projects window</a> is the main entry point for working in
      the IDE. All your source files must be part of a project, even if there is only one source
      file. to your project sources. It shows a logical view of important project contents such as
      source files, header files, and makefiles. You can right-click any project node to access a
      contextual menu of commands for building and running, as well as to open the Project
      Properties dialog box.
    </p>
    <p>
       See <a href="CandC++ProjectsMakefiles.html">C/C++/Fortran Projects and Makefiles</a> for
      more information about projects.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Files Window<a name="Files"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The <a href="FilesWindow.html">Files window</a> shows a directory-based view of your
      projects, including files and folders that are not displayed in the Projects window. From the
      Files window, you can open and edit your project configuration files, like the project build
      script and properties file. You can also view build outputs like object (<tt>.o</tt>) files
      and executable (<tt>.exe</tt>) files.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Navigator Window<a name="Navigator"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The Navigator window is a tool that displays information about selected C or C++ source
      files and the makefile in the currently open project. You can click a file in the Projects,
      Files, or Favorites window and the Navigator window displays information about the file's
      contents. You can double-click an item shown in the Navigator to open the file in the Source
      Editor. By default, the Navigator window is located in the lower lefthand corner of the IDE's
      workspace below the Projects and Files windows. See <a href=
      "../EditingSourceFiles/UsingNavigator.html">Using the Navigator Window</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Classes Window<a name="Classes"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The Classes window lets you see all of the classes in your C++ project, and the members and
      fields for each class. By default, the Classes window is located in the same section of the
      IDE's workspace as the Projects and Files windows. See <a href=
      "../EditingSourceFiles/UsingClassView.html">Using the Classes Window</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Source Editor Window<a name="Editor"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The Source Editor is a full-featured text editor that is integrated with the Projects window
      and the compilers. The Source Editor is automatically opened when a new and editable object
      is created from the available templates in the IDE. It can also be opened by double-clicking
      the node of an editable object in the Projects window or Navigator window. See <a href=
      "../EditingSourceFiles/EditingSourceFiles.html">Editing Source Files</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Compilers<a name="Compilers"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
       The Run menu contains commands for compiling applications. You can compile an entire project
      or compile single files. You can also access the most common compiling actions by using the
      command buttons in the Run toolbar or by using the keyboard equivalents. The toolbar buttons
      apply to the selected project.
    </p>
    <p>
       The IDE does not include C/C++ compilers. Instead it uses compilers that it finds in your
      path.
