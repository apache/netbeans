# Default locations of userdir and cachedir:
# (http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqWhatIsUserdir)
#
# The following variables can be used for these options:
# - default_userdir
# - default_cachedir
# - default_options
# - jdkhome
#
# On Windows ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with "<AppData>\<AppName>", where <AppData> is users value of "AppData" key
# in Windows Registry under
# "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders"
# and ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with the value of "<LocalAppData>\<AppName>\Cache" where "LocalAppData"
# is a key in Windows Registry under
# "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders".
# <AppName> is the the executable's filename without the extension.
#
# On Mac ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with "~/Library/Application Support/<AppName>" and
# ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} with "~/Library/Caches/<AppName>"
# where <AppName> is the launcher script's name.
#
# On other systems ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with "${HOME}/.<AppName>" and ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} with
# "${HOME}/.cache/<AppName>".
#
# You can also use ${HOME} variable which will be replaced with
# user.home JVM system property value. 
#
# NOTE: If you specify a non-default userdir path on command line
# (--userdir option) and don't specify a cachedir path (--cachedir option),
# cachedir will be in "<userdir>/var/cache".
#
# Cachedir must be different from userdir. The same cachedir and userdir
# would cause problems.
#
# ${BASEDIR} is replaced with the base directory of the NetBeans installation
#

default_userdir="${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT}/dev"
default_cachedir="${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT}/dev"

# options used by the launcher by default, can be overridden by explicit
# command line switches
default_options="--branding ${branding.token}"
# for development purposes you may wish to append: -J-Dnetbeans.logger.console=true -J-ea

# default location of JDK/JRE, can be overridden by using --jdkhome <dir> switch
#jdkhome="/path/to/jdk"

# clusters' paths separated by path.separator (semicolon on Windows, colon on Unices)
