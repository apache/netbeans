        <h2>Getting Started with GSF</h2>
        <p>
            Here's a quick checklist for how to get started writing
            language support with GSF.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First, you need to write a mime resolver to
                    associate source files of your language with a given
                    mime type. Your language will be associated with this
                    unique mime type. This is described in the
                    <a href="mime-resolver.html">mime resolver document</a>.
                    <br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, you need to write a lexer for your language.
                    This is described in the
                    <a href="lexing.html">lexing document</a>.
                    <br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, you need to write register your lexer with
                    GSF and set up basic GSF registration for your language.
                    This is described in the
                    <a href="registration.html">registration document</a>.
                    At this point, you have basic support for you language -
                    you can recognize and open files in the IDE, and the
                    files are syntax highlighted.
                    <br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, you can create an implementation of the
                    <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/KeystrokeHandler.html">KeystrokeHandler</a>
                    and register it with GSF, to support keystroke handling for
                    your language. This is where you can make matching quotes, parentheses
                    etc. happen automatically, as well as implementing return-key handling
                    such that you provide smart-indent, inserting matching tags when you
                    open an if-clause, and so on. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/Formatter.html">Formatter</a>.
                    This will provide basic indentation/formatting for your language.
                    <br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    At this point, you should be writing unit tests to check your features,
                    for all kinds of corner cases, as well as a guard against regressions
                    as you're improving your code. Unit testing GSF features is trivial; see
                    the <a href="unit-testing.html">unit testing document</a> for more details.
                    <br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The above features only relied on lexical analysis of your language.
                    The next set of features will require semantic/parse information.
                    To do this, you need to implement a parser for your language by implementing a
                    <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/Parser.html">Parser</a>.
                    Your parser will be called at the right times - and this topic
                    is explored in more detail in the 
                    <a href="parsing.html">parsing document</a>.
                    <br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once you have a parser, you can implement some basic features that require
                    parser information.
                    First, implement the 
                    <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/StructureScanner.html">StructureScanner</a>
                    interface. This lets you to provide a code outline of the current
                    file in the navigation window, as well as code folding regions in the editor.
                    You basically just need to iterate over your own parse tree, decide which
                    regions should be code folding regions and register them with GSF. Similarly,
                    for navigation, you just need to identify relevant "code elements" from your
                    AST, and then tell GSF about them using logical descriptors like
                    "method", "attribute", "tag", etc.
                    <br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, you can add some other related features which rely on your parsing result:
                    <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/SemanticAnalyzer.html">SemanticAnalyzer</a>,
                    <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/OccurrencesFinder.html">OccurrencesFinder</a>, and
                    <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/InstantRenamer.html">InstantRenamer</a>.
                    These features let you provide semantic highlighting (e.g. highlighting unused
                    variables, method declarations, etc), mark occurrences, and instant rename - refactoring
                    for things like local variables and parameters which doesn't require full blown
                    multi-file refactoring.
                    <br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are developing support for a language which can be embedded in other 
                    languages (such as JavaScript, which is embedded in HTML files etc., or Ruby,
                    which is embedded in ERb files), you need to handle the embedding aspects
                    of languages. At the syntactic level, this is handled completely by the
                    embedding language support. But at the parse level, it will require coordination
                    as well as careful use of offset translation methods; you should never assume
                    that your AST node offsets correspond to the offsets in the document.
                    This is described in more detail in the <a href="embedding.html">embedding document</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now you are finally ready to attack the "hardest" features: Code Completion,
                    Go To Declaration, and other features that require multifile analysis.
                    To do this, you need to have a persistent store such that you can quickly
                    query and find information across files and libraries. To do this, you need
                    to implement an indexer. The indexer is called by the infrastructure when needed,
                    and lets you extract information from parse results and store them into an index.
                    This is all explained in greater detail in the <a href="indexer.html">indexing document</a>.
                    You will also need to tell GSF how the user's project related to source code,
                    such that multifile analysis can be properly scoped. This part is described in
                    the <a href="classpath.html">classpath document</a>.
                    <br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    With the index in place, you can now implement code completion using the
                    <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/CodeCompletionHandler.html">CodeCompletionHandler</a>
                    interface. Here, you will most likely draw on everything you have built up to
                    this point. Lexical analysis, to for example determine if you're in a string or
                    a comment (where different completion alternatives present themselves), then the
                    parser AST to determine things like local variables, and finally the index to
                    determine other functions and classes in the project. Code completion also typically
                    involves attempting to analyze code which is broken (because you're in the middle
                    of typing an expression) so error recovery as discussed in the
                    <a href="parsing.html">parsing document</a> will also need to be perfected.
                    <br/><br/>
                    You can also implement Go To Declaration at this point, by implementing the
                    <a href="org/netbeans/modules/gsf/api/DeclarationFinder.html">DeclarationFinder</a>
                    interface and registering it with GSF.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I hope to write a more detailed document with information on how to write code
                    completion soon.
                    <br/><br/>
                </li>
                <li>
                  At some point, you should consider adding incremental updating support,
                  such as incremental parsing. This is described in detail in the
                  <a href="incremental-parsing.html">incremental parsing</a> document.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
