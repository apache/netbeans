<p>
A breakpoint is a flag in the source code that tells the debugger to
stop execution of the program. When your program stops on a
breakpoint, you can perform actions like examining the value of
variables and single-stepping through your program.
</p>
<p>
The IDE lets you set line, function, instruction, variable, exception,
and system call breakpoints in C or C++ applications using the New Breakpoint dialog box. You can also set
line breakpoints directly in the Source Editor by clicking the line
number.</p>
