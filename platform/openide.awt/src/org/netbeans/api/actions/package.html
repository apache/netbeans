<em>Context Interfaces</em>
are a design pattern used to add behaviors to existing objects
or to separate implementation from the main object.
Usually
one adds implementation of these interfaces into publically known
<a href="@org-openide-util-lookup@/org/openide/util/Lookup.html">Lookup</a> (like
those provided by <a href="@org-openide-nodes@/org/openide/nodes/Node.html">nodes</a>). These interfaces
are primarily designed for use with 
{@link org.openide.awt.Actions#context(java.lang.Class,boolean,boolean,org.openide.util.ContextAwareAction,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,boolean)  context actions }
.
