            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions

     <question id="compat-standards">
            Does the module implements or defines any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or it deviates somehow?
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-standards">
The module uses <a href="@JDK@@JDKMODULE_JAVA_DESKTOP@/javax/swing/text/package-summary.html">Swing text package</a>.
It extends it in <a href="@org-openide-text@/org/openide/text/NbDocument.html">NbDocument</a> class which adds
support for:
<ul>
<li><a href="@org-openide-text@/org/openide/text/NbDocument.WriteLockable.html">locking document for complex modifications</a></li>

<!-- Question: compat-version

     <question id="compat-version">
            Does your module properly coexists with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read settings? Will future
            versions be able to read settings?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
Module uses serialization. It coexists with the earlier versions, but 
not with future ones. The future versions will be able to read settings.

            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to

            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an
            API as well.

<answer id="exec-component">
The module can be influencend by this property:
<api type="export" group="property" name="indentEngine" category="stable" >
Property hold instance of <a href="@org-openide-text@/org/openide/text/IndentEngine.html">IndentEngine</a>
and this indentation engine is used instead of system one.
</api>

It set these Swing properties:
<api type="import" group="property" name="javax.swing.text.Document.StreamDescriptionProperty" category="stable" >
Property hold instance of <a href="@org-openide-loaders@/org/openide/loaders/DataObject.html">DataObject</a>
from which the document was created. This property can be used by the modules and is part of the Editor API.
</api>

<api type="import" group="property" name="javax.swing.text.Document.TitleProperty" category="stable" >
Property hold instance of String with name of the file being edited.
This property can be used by the modules and is part of the Editor API.
</api>

<api type="export" group="property" name="javax.swing.text.Document.modificationListener" category="friend" >
In order to fix <a href="https://bz.apache.org/netbeans/show_bug.cgi?id=51872">issue 51872</a> the 
openide needs a way how to be notified about change of a document outside of its Document lock. 
<code>DocumentListener</code>s are always notified under the lock, so a special contract has
been established (since version 5.3) by registering an instance of <code>VetoableListener</code>
by calling <code>putProperty ("modificationListener", listener)</code>. The
NetBeans aware documents are adviced to honor this property and call the listener
outside of the document lock when a modification is made. The actual contract
of the call can be seen in 
<a href="https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master/platform/openide.text/test/unit/src/org/openide/text/NbLikeEditorKit.java">NbLikeEditorKit.java</a> 
in methods 
<code>insertString</code> and <code>remove</code>.

</api>

<api type="export" group="property" name="beforeSaveRunnable" category="friend" >
    Document property that allows to execute a runnable before save of a document is performed.
    For example an extra whitespace accumulated during typing can be removed by exploiting this property.
</api>

<api type="export" group="property" name="expectedTime" category="friend" >
    <a href="@TOP@/org/openide/text/CloneableEditorSupport.html">CloneableEditorSupport</a>
    understands not only its <code>Env.TIME</code> property, but also special
    "expectedTime". When this one arrives, it means refresh its internal
    last saved time, but without any refresh. This functionality is used from
    <code>DataEditorSupport</code> when the DataObject is moved to new location
    and we need to adjust the time to the new file object.
</api>

<api type="export" group="property" name="usedByCloneableEditor" category="friend" >
    Component client property which is set to Boolean.TRUE if an editor pane is actively used by a cloneable editor.
    Once the component gets closed the CloneableEditor sets the property to Boolean.FALSE.

<api name="EditorKitInitialization" category="friend" group="java" type="export">
    In order to speedup, or remove the load of initialization of kit in AWT during startup,

<answer id="exec-property">
<api name="oldInitialization" category="devel" group="property" type="export">
    As the speedup of startup done in version 6.18 is not fully compatible,

            This usually indicates a missing or unsufficient API in the other

Yes, it calls protected method <a href="@org-openide-loaders@/org/openide/loaders/MultiDataObject.html#getCookieSet--">MultiDataObject.getCookieSet()</a>.

Another reflection is used in QuietEditorPane, where DelegatingTransferHandler delegates
also on two protected methods of TransferHandler: <code>createTransferable</code> and

<!-- Question: resources-file

     <question id="resources-file">
            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.

<!-- Question: resources-layer

     <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create some files or
            folders on it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            component?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

<!-- Question: resources-mask

     <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resource provided by another one in
            module layer? 
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
