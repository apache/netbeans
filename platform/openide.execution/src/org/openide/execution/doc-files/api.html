<h1>Execution API</h1>

<p>
The Execution API controls the execution of long-lived processes.
XXX need new documentation for this module!
</p>

<p><code>ThreadDeath</code> may be thrown by the execution engine if
the process is manually stopped (by the user or via its
<code>ExecutorTask</code>), so if you catch this it is best not to
print its stack trace. Also, the executed code within this method may
invoke <code>System.exit</code> to end the application, without
shutting down NetBeans.

<p>
A class running in
an external process whose output you wish to capture should
generally have its streams redirected to the Output Window, e.g. by
using

{@link java.lang.Process#getInputStream() Process.getInputStream() }.

The streams on the Output Window may be obtained from the execution
engine (see below), using

{@link org.openide.execution.ExecutorTask#getInputOutput()  ExecutorTask.getInputOutput() }

on the task returned from

{@link org.openide.execution.ExecutionEngine#execute(java.lang.String,java.lang.Runnable,org.openide.windows.InputOutput) ExecutionEngine.execute(...) },

and then

{@link org.openide.windows.InputOutput#getOut() InputOutput.getOut() }

and so on. Now you can just copy characters from one stream to the
other.
</p>

<p>
<em>Note</em> that
exceptions or errors occurring during the actual execution of the
process, once it has been successfully started, should be handled
within the scope of the <code>ExecutorTask</code> and normally this
just means printing the stack trace to the Output Window via an
<code>InputOutput</code> handle.
</p>

<p>
{@link org.openide.execution.NbProcessDescriptor NbProcessDescriptor }

is an object representing the abstract command template. This class
has a standard custom property editor which should be familiar to
anyone who has used external execution, compilation, or debugging: it
displays a dialog with a command name, some arguments in a panel, and
an optional description key.

<p>Typically both the command name and list of arguments are actually
templates for the real thing, with embedded substitution codes; then
the description key can explain to the user what the substitution
codes mean.

<p>The process descriptor itself does not include any information
about <em>how</em> to substitute these codes, if there are
any. Rather, it presents ways to create a running process from itself:

{@link org.openide.execution.NbProcessDescriptor#exec() NbProcessDescriptor.exec() }

simply runs the literally supplied string, assuming it does not need
any substitutions; but

{@link org.openide.execution.NbProcessDescriptor#exec(java.text.Format) NbProcessDescriptor.exec(Format) }

applies a (textual) format to the command name and arguments list
before invoking <code>Runtime.exec</code>. The format can in principle
be any format you like.
</p>

<p>
{@link org.openide.execution.NbClassPath NbClassPath }

is an object used to represent a classpath, which is of course
frequently used in Java-related applications, though implementors of
executors unrelated to Java development will probably ignore it. Its
main purpose is that it also has a custom property editor, making
it convenient to use as a Bean property on service types such as
executors.
</p>

<h2 id="io">Managing I/O</h2>

Typically, implementors of executors (or other external services such
as compilation) will wish for any I/O via standard system streams
(input, output, and error) to be redirected to the Output Window,
rather than going to the NetBeans console (and logfile) where the user
will not normally see it. In some cases, executed applications are
also expected or permitted to invoke <code>System.exit</code> to
terminate themselves, which should be prevented from terminating
NetBeans itself.

<p>NetBeans provides two forms of support for these considerations,
which complement one another in that they cover both <em>dynamic</em>
scope (code run within a certain thread group and time window) and
quasi-<em>lexical</em> scope (code derived from a certain
classloader). Both will accomplish automatic I/O redirection and
trapping of exit calls; implementors may use either or both to ensure
coverage of executed code.

<p>First it is necessary to describe the

{@link org.openide.windows.InputOutput InputOutput }

interface which is common to both forms of support. This interface is
essentially an abstract description of the public capabilities of an
Output Window tab. Thus, a certain level of control is afforded to
users of this interface in terms of managing selection of the tab,
getting its various I/O streams and using them, controlling whether
the two output streams are mixed together, etc.

<p>There are three ways to get a useful <code>InputOutput</code>
implementation:

<ol>

<li>You may use

{@link org.openide.windows.IOProvider#getIO(java.lang.String,boolean) IOProvider.getIO(String,boolean)} 

to create an Output Window tab with a specified name and return its
<code>InputOutput</code> representative. Or, try to reuse an existing tab of the same name, if there is one.

<li>If

{@link org.openide.execution.ExecutionEngine#execute(java.lang.String,java.lang.Runnable,org.openide.windows.InputOutput) ExecutionEngine.execute(...,InputOutput) }

is called and its third argument is <code>null</code>, this signifies
that the engine itself should choose an appropriate Output Window tab,
probably named after the supplied task name. The returned
<code>ExecutorTask</code> will then already be using the proper
<code>InputOutput</code>, and this may be retrieved if needed using

{@link org.openide.execution.ExecutorTask#getInputOutput() ExecutorTask.getInputOutput() }.

<li>You may use the constant

{@link org.openide.windows.InputOutput#NULL InputOutput.NULL }

to indicate that no I/O at all is desired for a task - that is, its I/O
streams will be trapped, but writes will be discarded and reads will
return end-of-file. This constant should be used if it is very clear
that I/O will not be used and some overhead should be saved; or if the
I/O is specifically not desired.

</ol>

<strong>Note</strong> that if you simply implement the
<code>InputOutput</code> interface yourself, it will not be "magic"
and the execution engine will not be able to use it for managing I/O,
so there is probably no reason to ever do so. Specifically this means
that there is currently no support in the APIs for running a task and
automatically redirecting its I/O to streams of the implementor's
choice; they may only be redirected to the Output Window.

<p>Given an <code>InputOutput</code>, you can use it in either of the
two ways given below, or both at the same time, and I/O streams will
be trapped.

<ol>

<li>{@link org.openide.execution.ExecutionEngine#execute(java.lang.String,java.lang.Runnable,org.openide.windows.InputOutput) ExecutionEngine.execute(...) }

is the primitive means for providing I/O services to a block of code
using dynamic scope.
(You may obtain the <code>ExecutionEngine</code> via

{@link org.openide.execution.ExecutionEngine#getDefault() ExecutionEngine.getDefault() }.)

The supplied <code>Runnable</code> is run
asynchronously in its own thread and thread group, i.e. well-isolated
from the rest of NetBeans. Any uses of the system I/O streams within
that thread group will automatically be trapped and redirected to the
<code>InputOutput</code>. Note that code which creates new threads
will normally create them in the same thread group as the calling
code, so it is fine for there to be complex multithreaded code in the
supplied runnable; it will all be handled. Runnable-spawned code which
is destined for other thread groups will not be handled, however; for
example,

{@link org.openide.util.RequestProcessor#post(java.lang.Runnable) RequestProcessor.post(Runnable) }

will execute code in NetBeans' main thread group, not the one created
by the execution engine.

<p>The supplied task name is optional and may be <code>null</code>. If
it is supplied, it will be used as a display name that may show up
e.g. in the Execution View, so that the user may see that the process
is running and stop it if needed. If <code>null</code>, the task will
not be visible to the user.

<p>As mentioned above, you may pass an existing
<code>InputOutput</code> to this method so as to ask the execution
engine to use that I/O; or you may leave this argument
<code>null</code> to request that a suitable I/O tab be created for
you. In either case, the I/O tab actually in use will be available via
<code>ExecutorTask.getInputOutput()</code>.

<p>The task returned from the engine permits you to find its I/O
implementation; let the runnable continue asynchronously; stop it at
any time; or wait for it to finish (i.e. block) and get its return
status. As far as return status goes, zero means success, nonzero
numbers mean failure. The execution engine's default task
implementation just considers natural termination of the
<code>Runnable</code> to be success, and aborted tasks to have failed
(and some unspecified nonzero number returned as the status). For some
uses, such as execution of external applications which may return a
meaningful exit status, you may need to create a special wrapper
<code>ExecutorTask</code> implementation which provides the correct
exit status (since the execution engine is not aware of such codes).

<p>The dynamic scope of <code>execute(...)</code> also covers
attempted uses of

{@link java.lang.System#exit(int) System.exit(int) }
(or
{@link java.lang.Runtime#exit(int) Runtime.exit(int) } ).

If an exit is attempted within the task's dynamic scope (i.e. thread
group), this is caught by the NetBeans security manager implementation,
and the task is instead stopped (as if by

{@link org.openide.execution.ExecutorTask#stop() ExecutorTask.stop() } ).

In practice this means that all living threads in the thread group
will receive

{@link java.lang.ThreadDeath ThreadDeath }

to stop them. So executor implementations should be prepared to have
thread death thrown on them, and anyone catching
<code>Throwable</code> should specifically consider whether the
throwable is a thread death; in this case, the surrounding code should
be stopped promptly, and there is no need to print a stack trace. The
thread death may be thrown either because of an attempted exit call,
or because of an explicit use of <code>ExecutorTask.stop()</code>.
(Note that there is no way to recover the exit status which the
attempted exit call used.)

<li>{@link org.openide.execution.NbClassLoader#NbClassLoader(org.openide.windows.InputOutput) new NbClassLoader(InputOutput) }

creates a special classloader that is aware of an
<code>InputOutput</code> obtained as above. Normally
<code>NbClassLoader</code> is just used to load classes from the
Repository. This constructor,
however, is "magic" in that it will still load classes from the
Repository (always giving preference to its parent
class loader),

but I/O calls quasi-lexically contained in such classes (i.e. made
directly by such a class, or by other invoked code when such a class
is on the stack) will be redirected to the supplied I/O.

<p>Note that this works regardless of thread group, so that for
example a runnable loaded from this classloader which is posted to the
<code>RequestProcessor</code> will still use I/O redirection, unlike
with <code>ExecutionEngine.execute(...)</code>.

<p><code>NbClassLoader</code> does not specially handle
<code>System.exit</code> calls since such code need not be in any
particular thread group, so it does not make sense to try to stop some
task. Rather, any code in the system which is outside the NetBeans
standard trusted codebase which tries to exit the VM will receive a
security exception. Note that this exception specifically does nothing
in response to <code>printStackTrace()</code>, which is usually
desirable because general-purpose exception catching code such as is
common in executors just prints any received stack traces, whereas
<code>System.exit</code> should simply end the task without triggering
a noisy and confusing <code>SecurityException</code> trace.

<p>The NetBeans trusted codebase
specifies that Java platform code, code loaded from modules (including
test modules), and code loaded from an <code>NbClassLoader</code> with
the <code>InputOutput</code> constructor is to be trustworthy; other
Filesystems code will typically fall outside of these codebases and so
is subject to the security manager. Such "untrusted" code is probably
restricted from security-sensitive calls (but do not count on it).
Such code can still call

{@link org.openide.LifecycleManager#exit() LifecycleManager.exit() }
to explicitly exit NetBeans.

</ol>

<p>Each of the three I/O streams from the generated process (created
by <code>createProcess</code> which is described in detail above) are
assigned to one of the I/O streams associated with the
<code>InputOutput</code>. Each such pairing is implemented by a
separate thread; this runs in the thread group created by the
execution engine, since it was created by the runnable.

<p>The external executor actually keeps track of the entire
<code>ExecutorTask</code> provided by the execution engine, not just
its <code>InputOutput</code>, since it cannot rely on the execution
engine to kill the external process directly. (The execution engine
normally just kills all threads in the thread group it created, in
order to stop a task it created.) Rather, the internal runnable
creates a <em>new</em> <code>ExecutorTask</code> which provides the
additional needed behavior and returns it in proxy, while keeping the
original for its own use.

<p>The main trick involves program termination (from NetBeans). If the
code calling <code>ProcessExecutor.execute</code> pays attention to
its returned task and directly calls <code>ExecutorTask.stop</code> on
this task, then there is no problem: this method is directly
implemented to stop both the external process itself, and all I/O
proxy threads. Stopping the process causes the <code>result</code>
method to unblock and get an exit status, which also notifies task
listeners that the task is finished; and when the last proxy thread
stops, then the execution engine sees that the thread group is dead
(no live threads remain in it) and so it also knows that its own task
is finished, causing (among other things) that entry to disappear from
the list of processes in the Execution View.

<p><em>But</em> if the task is stopped from the Execution View
(i.e. <code>stop</code> is called on the execution engine's own task,
rather than the synthetic task from <code>ProcessExecutor</code>),
then the synthetic task needs to be stopped as well. This is
implemented by having the synthetic task attach a task listener to the
original one; when the original one finishes, the synthetic one stops
itself as well (and consequently shuts down the external process and
the copy threads, if they have not been killed already).
