The project is based on the requirement to access all J2ee deployment descriptor files 
for other Netbeans modules in a simple and J2EE spec.-independant way. This module replaces
the Web DD API (web/ddapi) module form the Web area.

The J2EE DD API is based on a bunch of interfaces based on the deployment descriptor xml structure. The names of interfaces correspond to the names of deployment descriptor elements in the J2EE DD files like ejb-jar.xml, web.xml or applicaiton.xml.
The DD API interfaces are organized in  a hierarchic tree structure and are accassible through the root (<b>Application</b>), (<b>WebApp</b>) or (<b>EjbJar</b>) interfaces.
The implementation of DD API interfaces is hidden for clients.  It is based on schema2beans infrastructure and is the DD version - specific. 
(there is always requirement to support at least two successive versions of DD specification). 
The implementation is located in <b>non-public</b> packages of <a href="index.html">j2ee/ddapi</a> module. 
It is expected that interfaces will not be implemented by the client.<br/>
The root of the deployment descriptor is accessible through the <b>DDProvider</b> class.

<answer id="arch-usecases">

<usecase id="web-dd-1" name="J2EE Application" >
J2EE Aplications often need to explore the included modules. 
Ejb modules are usually used as components of a J2EE application.
Web modules are usually used as clients or front-end  components of J2EE application.<br/>
There is a requirement to be able to identify the sub-elements of web modules that are included to J2EE Application. 
For example, the J2EE Application need to be able to create a web module (<b>WEB client</b>), 
with the default web.xml file, then create a display-name and add a servlet element to deployment descriptor.
Similarly, the J2EE Application need to be able to create an ejb module, with the default ejb-jar.xml file, 
then create a display-name and add an ejb element to deployment descriptor.
</usecase>

<usecase id="web-dd-2" name="Web Services Based on Servlet">
	JAX-RPC Web Services based on servlet need to include specific elemens to deployment descriptor and map the service to a URL that specifies where the WSDL file can be found.<br/>
	See the example (JWSDP1.2)  :
<pre>
<code>
<b>&lt;listener&gt;</b>
  <b>&lt;listener-class&gt;</b>com.sun.xml.rpc.server.http.JAXRPCContextListener<b>&lt;/listener-class&gt;</b>
<b>&lt;/listener&gt;</b>
<b>&lt;servlet&gt;</b>
  <b>&lt;servlet-name&gt;</b>Hello<b>&lt;/servlet-name&gt;</b>
  <b>&lt;display-name&gt;</b>Hello<b>&lt;/display-name&gt;</b>
  <b>&lt;description&gt;</b>JAX-RPC endpoint - Hello<b>&lt;/description&gt;</b>
  <b>&lt;servlet-class&gt;</b>com.sun.xml.rpc.server.http.JAXRPCServlet<b>&lt;/servlet-class&gt;</b>
  <b>&lt;load-on-startup&gt;</b>1<b>&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;</b>
<b>&lt;/servlet&gt;</b>
<b>&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;</b>
 <b> &lt;servlet-name&gt;</b>Hello<b>&lt;/servlet-name&gt;</b>
  <b>&lt;url-pattern&gt;/</b>hello<b>&lt;/url-pattern&gt;</b>
<b>&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;</b>
</code>
</pre>
</usecase>

<usecase id="web-dd-3" name="Web Application Wizards">
	There are several wizards that need to insert elements to DD regarding the type of the wizard.<br/>
	Examples :
	<ul>
	<li><b>Web Module Wizard</b> - need to specify the web module  &lt;display-name&gt; and &lt;locale-encoding-mapping-list&gt;</li>
	<li><b>Servlet Wizard</b> - need to specify the &lt;servlet&gt; and &lt;servlet-mapping&gt; elements</li>
	<li><b>Listener Wizard</b> - need to specify the &lt;listener&gt; element</li>
	<li><b>Filter Wizard</b> - need to specify the &lt;filter&gt; and &lt;filter-mapping&gt; elements</li>
	</ul>
    <p/>
</usecase>

<usecase id="web-dd-4" name="DD Editor">
<p>
	DD Editor significantly improves DD editing in the way that user doesn't need to know the syntax of 
        deployment descriptor file.
        It is desirable for DD Editor module to work with DD API interfaces instead of  
        working with  s2b beans directly (generated specifically for the particular version of DD). 
        This method was used in previous versions of IDE.
</p>
</usecase>

<usecase id="web-dd-5" name="Other modules that need to modify the deployment descriptor">
	This is the list of other possible clients of DD API :
	<ul>
	<li><b>RAVE</b></li>
	<li><b>JATO module</b></li>
	<li><b>STRUTS module</b></li>
	</ul>
An example of this is adding EJB reference to allow the module to call an EJB in another EJB module.

<answer id="compat-version">
The DD API need do be flexible enough towards the future changes in J2EE specification. Nowadays DD API accepts both the DTD and XML schema files. 
It is expected that in future the XML schema for deployment descriptor will be changed. 
The DD API is prepared for changes that either break or not break the backward compatibility regarding the J2EE specification.<br/>
It is expected that :
<ul>
<li>some interfaces/methods can be added for new versions</li>
<li>some methods can turned to throw the VersionNotSupportedException in the future</li>
</ul><br/>
There is supossed that DD API will support at least 2 successive versions of XML schema for J2EE application deployment descriptor.<br/><br/>
As implementation is supposed to be fully the part of j2ee/ddapi module, no problems with adding new interfaces/methods to the future versions of DD API are expected.<br/>

                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
