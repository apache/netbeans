 *	TestExtensionSample - test the basic features.
 *
 *	The following test assumes that we know the content of the
 *	graph as we get elements, add and change them. Therefore, the TestExtensionSample.xml
 *	file and this java test should be kept in sync.
 *
 * 	Test the following:
 *
 *	single String: get/set/remove/set/get
 *	boolean (from true): get/set true/get/set false/get/set true/get
 *	boolean (from false): get/set false/get/set true/get/set false/get
 *	String[]: get/set (null & !null)/add/remove
 *	Bean: remove/set(null)/create bean and graph of beans/set/add
