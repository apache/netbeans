/**
 * An interceptor which is called when text is typed into a document. You should
 * implement this interface if you want to hook in the keyboard input
 * processing done in the editor infrastructure that would normally result in inserting text
 * into a document. Typically, implementations of this interface will be called
 * when processing <code>KeyEvent</code>s that reach a default keymap action (ie.
 * there is no entry in the editor's keymap for this particular <code>KeyEvent</code>).
 *
 * <p><b>Registration</b>: <code>TypedTextInterceptor</code>s can be plugged in the editor infrastructure
 * by implementing the {@link Factory} interface and registering it in <code>MimeLookup</code>
 * under the appropriate mimetype (ie <code>MimePath</code>).
 *
 * <p>The instances created from the <code>Factory</code> will be reused for processing
 * all keyboard input received by all documents of the same mime type, which the interceptor
 * instances were registered for (including documents that contain embedded sections
 * of that mime type). As described in the general concepts of Typing Hooks SPI
 * the interceptors are guaranteed to be called in AWT thread only, which means that
 * they should not need any internal synchronization model.
 *
 * <p><b>Processing rules</b>: If there are multiple instances of <code>TypedTextInterceptor</code> registered
 * for the same mime type the infrastructure will queue them up in their registration
 * order and when processing an event it will call them all until the processing is done
 * or terminated. 
 *
 * <p>The interceptor has several methods that are called at different stages of
 * the key typed event processing. When processing an event the infrastructure will call
 * the methods in the order as they are listed below. Moreover, if there are multiple
 * interceptors queued up for processing an event each method is first called on
 * all the queued interceptors before moving on to the next stage and calling next
 * method.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #beforeInsert(Context)} - It's called before any text is inserted
 *   into a document. No document lock is held when this method is called. The method
 *   can't modify the text that will be inserted (and it's not supposed to do any tricks to
 *   break this rule). An interceptor can stop further processing of the event by returning
 *   <code>true</code> from this method. If it does so, no other interceptors'
 *   <code>beforeInsert</code> method will be called and the processing will be terminated
 *   without inserting any text.
 *
 * <li>{@link #insert(MutableContext)} - This method is called during the text
 *   insertion stage immediately before the text is inserted into a document. At this
 *   time the document is already write locked, but the interceptors are not expected
 *   to modify its content directly. Instead they can change the text that will be
 *   inserted by calling {@link MutableContext#setText(java.lang.String, int)} method.
 *   The text insertion is strictly controlled by the infrastructure and has to obey some
 *   additional rules (eg. correctly replacing selected text, handling insert vs override
 *   modes of the caret, etc). The first interceptor that modifies the insertion text
 *   will win and no other interceptor's <code>insert</code> method will be called.
 *
 * <li>{@link #afterInsert(Context)} - This is the last method in the processing
 *   chain and it will be called when the text is already inserted in the document.
 *   Similarly as in <code>beforeInsert</code> the document is not locked when
 *   this method is called.
 * 
 * <li>{@link #cancelled(Context)} - This is an additional method that will be called
 *   when the processing is terminated in the before-insertion stage (ie. by an interceptor
 *   returning <code>true</code> from its <code>beforeInsert</code> method).
 *   The infrastructure will only call this method on interceptors that have already
 *   had their <code>beforeInsert</code> method called, but not on those that
 *   have not yet been called at all.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Errors recovery</b>: If an exception is thrown from any of the methods
 * when calling an interceptor the infrastructure will catch it and log it,
 * but it will not stop further processing. The infrastructure may blacklist the offending
 * interceptor and exclude it from processing future events.
