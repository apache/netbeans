INFO FOR PEOPLE ADDING CHANGES:

Check the DTD (apichanges.dtd) for details on the syntax. You do not
need to regenerate the HTML, as this is part of Javadoc generation; just
change the XML. Rough syntax of a change (several parts optional):

<change>
    <api name="compiler"/>
    <summary>Some brief description here, can use <b>XHTML</b></summary>
    <version major="1" minor="99"/>
    <date day="13" month="6" year="2001"/>
    <author login="jrhacker"/>
    <compatibility addition="yes"/>
    <description>
        The main description of the change here.
        Again can use full <b>XHTML</b> as needed.
    </description>
    <class package="org.openide.compiler" name="DoWhatIWantCompiler"/>
    <issue number="14309"/>
</change>

Also permitted elements: <package>, <branch>. <version> is API spec
version, recommended for all new changes. <compatibility> should say
if things were added/modified/deprecated/etc. and give all information
related to upgrading old code. List affected top-level classes and
link to issue numbers if applicable. See the DTD for more details.

Changes need not be in any particular order, they are sorted in various
ways by the stylesheet anyway.

Dates are assumed to mean "on the trunk". If you *also* make the same
change on a stabilization branch, use the <branch> tag to indicate this
and explain why the change was made on a branch in the <description>.

Please only change this file on the trunk! Rather: you can change it
on branches if you want, but these changes will be ignored; only the
trunk version of this file is important.

Deprecations do not count as incompatible, assuming that code using the
deprecated calls continues to see their documented behavior. But do
specify deprecation="yes" in <compatibility>.

This file is not a replacement for Javadoc: it is intended to list changes,
not describe the complete current behavior, for which ordinary documentation
is the proper place.

                    Added a <code>isValid</code> method into <code>JavaPlatform</code>
                    to check platform validity. The platform is non valid when it's deleted
                    or an platform tool (java, javac) is missing or bootstrap libraries are missing.

                    Runtime compatibility remains, compile time compatibility is
                    mostly preserved too. It is however recommended to upgrade
                    dependencies of client modules. Try running
                    <code>ant fix-dependencies</code> in your Ant module.

                <p>
                    Code which previously handled null return values
                    but expected any returned platform instance to
                    meet certain criteria, such as having JDK tool bindings,
                    may be broken.

                <p>
                    <code>JavaPlatformManager.getDefaultPlatform</code>
                    could formerly return null, in case no installed
                    providers returned an instance; typically this
                    would be due to some storage problem. In the
                    interests of robustness, it will now as a fallback
                    return a simple platform instance corresponding
                    the JRE hosting the NetBeans code. Optional
                    capabilities may be missing so avoid relying on
                    this fallback platform implementation.

        <change id="CustomPlatformInstall">
            <api name="general"/>
            <summary>Added new CustomPlatformInstall implemented by the platform installers which does not use the file chooser to select new platform</summary>
            <version major="1" minor="5"/>
            <date day="27" month="7" year="2005"/>

            <description>
                <p>
                There are some platform installers which does not use the local disk as source of the java platform,
                for example they download the java platform from the web. Such installers cannot use the current
                PlatformInstall which is file oriented. The CustomPlatformInstall allows to platform install
                provider to implement its own way of installing the new platform. The PlatformInstall is still supported.
                If the module provides the PlatformInstall in the global lookup, the java platform module does the
                java platform chooser for it, the behavior is not changed. If the module provides the CustomPlatformInstall
                in the global lookup, it has to do the platform selection by itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                The relevant code was moved off to <code>java.platform.ui</code> module. Please

                    To indicate that this is now considered a stable API, the major release version was
