    Description:
        XML DTD for validation xml.
        validation.xml is used to specify validations to be applied
        to the given elements.

<!--
This is the root element
-->
<!ELEMENT validation  (element*) >
<!ATTLIST validation
        validate    CDATA        (true | false)     "true">


<!--
This element represents, the set of Constraints to be applied to
the given element.
-->
<!ELEMENT element (name, check*)>


<!--
This element represents, a particular Constraint.
Note : Information about this Constraint must be provided through
corresponding <check-info> object in constraints.xml Sub element
<name> should match with <name> of corresponding <check-info>
element defined in constraints.xml.
-->
<!ELEMENT check (name, parameters?)>


<!--
This element represent, Constraint parameters.
Number of sub elements, <parameter> should match with the number
of <argument> sub elements, of corresponding <arguments> element
in constraints.xml
-->
<!ELEMENT parameters (parameter+)>


<!--
This element represents, a Constraint parameter.
Sub elements <name> should match with the <name> sub element of
corresponding <argument> element in constraints.xml
<value> could be one or more. In case of an variable array
argument, multiple <value> elements will be used.
Example : InConstraint

<!ELEMENT parameter (name, value+)>


<!--
Used in elements : <element>, <check> and <parameter>
In <element> , it represents the name(xpath - complete absolute
name of an element(leaf).
In <check> , it represents name of a Constraint. This is the
linking element for <check> element in validation.xml and
<check-info> element in constraints.xml.
In <parameter>, it represents name of parameter. This is the
linking element for <parameter> element in validation.xml and
<argument> element in constraints.xml.

<!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)>


<!--
This element represents the value of a parameter.
