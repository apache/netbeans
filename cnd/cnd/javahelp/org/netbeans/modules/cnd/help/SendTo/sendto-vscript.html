<title>SendTo Validation Scripts</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>SendTo Validation Scripts</h2>
<p>A SendTo validation script is a script
that is executed to find out whether a selected script could be
applied to the selected files.
</p>
<p>A validation script can be written in any scripting
language that is supported on your system.  You can specify the command to be used
to execute the script. The default command is <tt>/bin/sh</tt>.
</p>
<p>Validation is considered to be successful if and
only if the exit status of the script is 0.
</p>
<p>The validation status of selected files is
invalidated when:
<ul>
<li>Another set of files is selected</li>
<li>Any selected file is changed either from
within IDE or externally</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not specify a validation script when
you create a script to act on selected files,
no validation is performed and script is considered as
valid.
</p>
<p>A validation script, when invoked, uses full paths
to all selected files as its parameters.
No input or output is displayed in the IDE.
