        <question id="arch-what">
            What is this project good for?
            <hint>
            Please provide here a few lines describing the project,
            what problem it should solve, provide links to documentation,
            specifications, etc.

<answer id="arch-what">
The diff module provides the ability to visualize differences between source files.
It also has a graphical conflicts resolver tool and built-in patch algorithm.
<p>List of the main features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple APIs, that provide access to registered diff and merge engines and visualizers.</li>
  <li>Built in and external diff engines defined.</li>
  <li>Graphical diff vizualizer and conflicts resolver.</li>
  <li>Extensible with additional diff and merge engines and vizualizers.</li>
  <li>Patch algorithm implemented for UNIX-style, unidiff and contextual diff formats.</li>
</ul>
</answer>



<!--
        <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.
            </hint>

<answer id="compat-i18n">
    Yes.
</answer>



<!--
        <question id="compat-standards">
            Does the module implement or define any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or does it deviate somehow?
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-standards">
    The external diff engine expect the standard UNIX-style output of the external
    diff executable.
     
    The patching algorithm supports three diff formats:
<ul>
  <li>Standard UNIX-style diff format,</li>
  <li>Unidiff format,</li>
  <li>Contextual diff format.</li>
</ul>
</answer>



<!--
        <question id="compat-version">
            Can your module coexist with earlier and future
            versions of itself? Can you correctly read all old settings? Will future
            versions be able to read your current settings? Can you read
            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
    Only one version of the module can be installed at a time. 
    The settings are shared across different versions, stored
    and read by Java serialization and will be read in future as well.

            Some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org/">libraries</a>) and
            it is prefered to use this approach when more modules may

            If it uses more than one JAR, describe where they are located, how
            they refer to each other.

        <question id="deploy-packages">
            Are packages of your module made inaccessible by not declaring them
            public?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used
            whenever possible (<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/download/apis/org/openide/doc-files/upgrade.html#3.4-public-packages">
            public packages

<answer id="deploy-packages">
    All public packages are accessible, no restriction applied. Diff module contains <api group="java" name="DiffAPI" type="export" category="official"/>.
    Some parts of VCS modules can use semi-private API <api group="java" name="DiffImplementationAPI" type="export" category="friend"/>, namely org.netbeans.modules.diff.builtin.DiffPresenter.

            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an

            Check for cases when you have an object of type A and you also
            expect it to (possibly) be of type B and do some special action. That

            If there is a property that can change the behaviour of your

    Yes. The module defines the provided diff and merge engines and visualizers

            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend

            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to? How the
            project behaves with respect to threading?
            <hint>
                Is your API threadsafe? Can it be accessed from any threads or
                just from some dedicated ones? Any special relation to AWT and
                its Event Dispatch thread? Also
                if your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
                Also describe when any events are fired: synchronously, asynchronously, etc.
