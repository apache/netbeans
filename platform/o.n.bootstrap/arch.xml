    <answer id="arch-what">
        The NetBeans launcher starts the application. Different launchers are
        provided for different supported platforms - Unix/Linux, Windows, and
        others. There are also a handful of classes in the
        <code>org.netbeans</code> and <code>org.netbeans.core</code> packages
        which directly support early startup features, such as command-line
        options.

<!--
        <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.

    <answer id="compat-i18n">
        Yes, except for early-startup code (including the native launcher) that
        deals with the command line.

<!--
        <question id="compat-standards">
            Does the module implement or define any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or does it deviate somehow?

    <answer id="compat-standards">
        No.
    </answer>



<!--
        <question id="compat-version">
            Can your module coexist with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read all old settings? Will future
            versions be able to read your current settings? Can you read
            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.

            <hint>
            It is expected that if your module runs on 1.x that it will run 
            on 1.x+1 if no, state that please. Also describe here cases where
            you run different code on different versions of JRE and why.

<!--
        <question id="dep-jrejdk">
            Do you require the JDK or is the JRE enough?
        </question>
-->
    <answer id="dep-jrejdk">
        The launcher itself does not use the JDK. The Unix and windows launchers permit
        either the JDK or JRE to be specified - if the JRE is specified, modules
        with hard dependencies on JDK tools (e.g. the JPDA Debugger module) will
        simply not be loaded. For other launchers, unknown.

            Some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org">libraries</a>) and
            it is prefered to use this approach when more modules may

        The bootstrap code of course uses reflection to start the normal core.

        around a variety of JRE bugs in handling loading from JAR files,

        load from JARs is rather buggy when it comes to changing or removing the

        <p>
            NetBeans Module system is optimized to eliminate useless I/O
            operations on start (as a result the <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Netbinox">
            embedded OSGi container</a> is fastest on the planet -- with respect to 
            application start up time). This is achieved by caching information
            known to have been needed in previous starts and using it
            rather than obtaining it again from the module JAR files.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are various caches (like 
                <a href="@TOP@/architecture-summary.html#java.io.File-all-layers.dat">all-layers.dat</a>,
                <a href="@TOP@/architecture-summary.html#java.io.File-all-manifests.dat">all-manifests.dat</a>,
                <a href="@TOP@/architecture-summary.html#java.io.File-all-resources.dat">all-resources.dat</a>,
                <a href="@org-netbeans-core-netigso@/architecture-summary.html#java.io.File-netigso-bundles">netigso-bundles</a>,
                etc.
            ) provided by the module system or by other subsystems of the application.
            Together, working in orchestration, they eliminate the need to
            touch the disk (which is very slow operation especially during
            <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Startup#Morning_Launch">morning launch</a>).
            Btw. there is a <a href="https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master/platform/core.startup/test/unit/src/org/netbeans/core/startup/layers/CachingPreventsFileTouchesTest.java">
            test which verifies</a> 
            the caching system really works
            -- it is recommended for each product built on top of NetBeans Platform
            to copy and adjust it to verify the caches are really used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, the caches may get out of date, for example when an external
            tool modifies the installation layout. 
            How can the system detect whether the caches are valid and 
            still be usable? The only way to verify the
            caches are 100% correct is to regenerate them and compare whether the
            cached bits are the same. However that would be terribly slow and defeat 
            the whole purpose of using caches.
        </p>
        <p>
            As such we have the <a href="@TOP@/architecture-summary.html#java.io.File-.lastModified">lastModified API</a>.
            Every cluster (as enumerated by <a href="@TOP@/architecture-summary.html#systemproperty-netbeans.dirs">netbeans.dirs</a>
            and <a href="@TOP@/architecture-summary.html#systemproperty-netbeans.home">netbeans.home</a> properties)
            is supposed to contain such file. Whenever an external tool changes something
            inside some cluster, it is supposed to touch the file and change its 
            timestamp. That will tell the system that caches are invalid 
            (as their timestamps will become older than newest <code>.lastModified</code> file).
        </p>
     </usecase>
     <usecase id="shared.cache" name="Generating Shared Cache">
         <p>
             The caches (as introduced in <a href="@TOP@/architecture-summary.html#usecase-invalidate.cache">
             invalidating caches</a> section) are optimized to reflect the state of 
             previous start. However that means, the very first start runs
             without them. This may not be a problem (if the start follows
             immediately after installation), however in <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Startup#Multi_User_Initial_Launch">
             multi user environment</a> (when the installation is done by administrator), 
             the first start may be slow. 
         </p>
         <p>
             To mitigate that the system offers support for <em>shared caches</em>.
             As part of installation, one can also copy <a href="@TOP@/architecture-summary.html#java.io.File-installation.cache">
             certain cache files
             </a> into the shared location. Those files will then be used
             on a first start of the system (when the user directory is empty).
         </p>
         <p>
             To generate the shared cache files start NetBeans with an empty,
             temporary user directory and then copy the desired files into
             first cluster directory:
         </p>
         <pre>
$ netbeans --userdir /tmp/nb -J-Dnetbeans.close=true -J-Dorg.netbeans.core.WindowSystem.show=false
$ cd /tmp/nb
$ zip -r $INSTALL/$first_netbeans_dirs_dir/var/cache/populate.zip var/cache/netigso
$ cp var/cache/* $INSTALL/$first_netbeans_dirs_dir/var/cache
$ rm -r /tmp/nb/
         </pre>
         <p>
             The meaning of <code>populate.zip</code> and list of known cache
             files is described <a href="@TOP@/architecture-summary.html#java.io.File-installation.cache">here</a>.
             Additional modules and subsystems may add new files however. The 
             ultimate knowledge is available only to those who understand overall
             product installation structure.
         </p>

     <usecase name="Patch classes" id="patch">

         <p>
         In case one wants to modify other classes before they get loaded into
         the VM, one can register its own
         <code>Agent-Class</code> and then be called whenever another
         class is defined. The behavior matches as closely as possible the one
         provided by <a href="@JDK@/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html">
         JDK instrument package</a>. To patch bytecode of other classes
         register your class in manifest and in its static <code>agentmain</code> method
         add your own <a href="@JDK@/java/lang/instrument/ClassFileTransformer.html">ClassFileTransformer</a>
         which will then be consulted whenever new classes are loaded.
         </p>
         <pre>
# following line should be in manifest of your module
Agent-Class: your.pkg.Transformer             

// this should be your class
package your.pkg;
public class Transformer implements ClassFileTransformer {
    public static void agentmain(String args, Instrumentation i) {
        i.addTransformer(new Transformer());
    }
             
    public byte[] transform(
        ClassLoader loader, String className, Class classBeingRedefined, 
        ProtectionDomain protectionDomain, byte[] classfileBuffer
    ) {
        // do your transformation
    }
}
</pre>
        <p>
        The implementation tries to be as complient as possible with the
        original JDK's specification, but 
        some differences are inevitable. For example the <code>classBeingRedefined</code>
        parameter in the previous example is always <code>null</code>
        as NetBeans runtime container does not
        have access to the class instance that is being defined yet.

            This is a specific case of <a href="#usecase-patch">Patch Classes</a> use-case.
            To maintain binary compatibility when <b>removing</b> methods from API classes,
            the "removed" implementation is actually moved to a special class, which becomes
            a <i>superclass</i> of the original API class. Such special classes should be
            separated into a 'compat' module, which is only loaded in presence of old clients.
         </p>
         <p>
            The compat module should declare it is a fragment of the original API module in its
            <code>MANIFEST.MF</code>
         </p>
            <pre>
OpenIDE-Module-Fragment-Host: orignal.module.codename
            </pre>
        <p>
            which ensures contents of the compat module will be loaded using classloader
            of the 'fragment host' module. The compat module will not get its own classloader.
            The special class itself should be marked using <a href="@org-openide-modules@/org/openide/modules/PatchFor.html">PatchFor</a> annotation,
            which causes it will be patched as superclass and inserted into the inheritance

            Does your module uses preferences via Preferences API? Does your module use NbPreferences or
            or regular JDK Preferences ? Does it read, write or both ? 
            Does it share preferences with other modules ? If so, then why ?
            <hint>
                You may use
                    &lt;api type="export" group="preferences"
                    name="preference node name" category="private"&gt;
                    description of individual keys, where it is used, what it
                    influences, whether the module reads/write it, etc.
                    &lt;/api&gt;
                Due to XML ID restrictions, rather than /org/netbeans/modules/foo give the "name" as org.netbeans.modules.foo.
                Note that if you use NbPreferences this name will then be the same as the code name base of the module.
