                        This article explains how you can use the built-in features of NetBeans 5.0 to create JAX-WS 2.0 services quickly. Once the project has been created, it can be rebuilt (and tested!) with one command. While newer versions of NetBeans include the ability to create JAX-RPC 1.X web services, the JAX-WS 2.0 code is still under development. The steps to create a web service with JAX-WS 2.0 have been simplified, and you can turn a web application project in NetBeans into a web service with very few steps.
