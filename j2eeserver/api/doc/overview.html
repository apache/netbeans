J2EE Server Module provides support for development of J2EE modules and
framework for J2EE server management and for J2EE deployment in IDE.

There are two separate api/spi sets in j2eeserver. The devmodules
api/spi is for j2ee development modules (web, j2ee app, etc). The
plugins api/spi is for server plugins.
<h2> devmodules
</h2>
The spi classes are to be subclassed by dev modules and to be provided
as cookies on the development nodes. The api classes are to be used to
add actions/properties/additional cookies to those nodes.
<h2> plugins
</h2>

A jsr88 plugin needs to be wrapped in a module with an entry in the
/J2EE/DeploymentPlugins folder in the default filesystem, so the server
registry can pick it up. In addition to that plugin is also
required to provide a J2EE Platform. In order to do it, plugin must implement the 
{@link org.netbeans.modules.j2ee.deployment.plugins.spi.J2eePlatformImpl} 
interface and register it via the
{@link org.netbeans.modules.j2ee.deployment.plugins.spi.J2eePlatformFactory} 
whose instance must be registered in the module 
<a href="org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/deployment/plugins/api/doc-files/plugin-layer-file.html">layer file</a>.

Plugin may also provide some additional functionality outside the
deployment spec through use of the
api/spi classes.&nbsp; These additional functionality neeed to be
declared through the plugin module 
<a href="org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/deployment/plugins/api/doc-files/plugin-layer-file.html">layer file</a>.
<h2> test plugin
</h2>
The j2eeserver/test directory contains the source to a sample plugin
containing both jsr88 classes and the wrapper to install this into the
registry.
<h2> user view and design
</h2>
<p>Documents are available <a href="http://j2eeserver.netbeans.org">online</a>.
