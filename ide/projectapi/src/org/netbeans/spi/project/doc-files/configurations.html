<h1>Project Configurations</h1>

  <p>
   NetBeans 4.0 introduced a project system that initially defined only project-wide build and run actions;
   per-file build and run actions were added during the 4.0 development cycle. Project build and run options,
   however, remained project-wide in the common project types such as <code>j2seproject</code> and thus were not
   meaningful for per-file actions. Many users objected particularly to the inability to separately configure
   command-line application arguments for classes with main methods inside a project.
  </p>
  <p>
   The project system did not <em>prevent</em> project types from adding such facilities, and in fact the
   NetBeans Mobility Pack’s Java ME project type soon provided a rich project configuration system used to
   control a variety of build and run characteristics (such as the device emulator to use). The newer CND
   (C/C++/native) project type also uses configurations.
  </p>
  <p>
   This proposal tries to address these limitations (probably for NetBeans 6.0). An SPI with matching GUI is
   introduced to permit a shared UI gesture for changing a project’s configuration. Additionally, the Java SE
   project type (<code>j2seproject</code>) is modified to include run configurations.
  </p>
 </dd>
</dl>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>
 Basic goals include:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   Some kind of configurations for <code>j2seproject</code>s, tracked in
   <a href="https://bz.apache.org/netbeans/show_bug.cgi?id=49636">issue #49636</a> with many votes.
   See also the <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/wiki/RunConfigurations49636">wiki page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
   The most frequently requested ability, considered to be a functional regression in NB 4.0 from 3.x, is
   <dfn>per-class application args</dfn> (passed as a <code>String[]</code> to a <code>main</code> method). This
   is adopted as a primary goal for this proposal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some people have requested the ability to customize other run parameters on a per-class basis, e.g. JVM
   startup parameters. This is considered a secondary goal, but the proposed implementation does address it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Others have requested build configurations, e.g. debug vs. release builds. This is also considered a
   secondary goal, since the Java language permits little variation in build semantics anyway, and most
   interesting production release targets (e.g. creating a Pack200 JAR) can process binaries built for
   development purposes. The proposed implementation permits build configurations at the Ant level but provides
   no GUI support for them.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   A common SPI for selecting configurations across project types, tracked in
   <a href="https://bz.apache.org/netbeans/show_bug.cgi?id=49652">issue #49652</a>. The proposed
   implementation addresses this, including a common GUI for switching configuration that can work with
   different project types.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is not a goal for the common GUI to work with the old APIs in Java ME and CND projects, but these should
   be easily migrated to the new SPI.
  </p>
 </li>
</ol>

<h1>API Change Overview</h1>
<p>
 Several API changes are proposed.
</p>

<h2>Project Configuration SPI</h2>
<p>
 An SPI for defining configurations available in a project is needed. This SPI is adopted from an SPI already
 used in the Java ME project type (and copied to the CND project type), with only minor changes.
</p>
<pre>
package org.netbeans.spi.project;
public interface ProjectConfigurationProvider {
    String PROP_CONFIGURATION_ACTIVE;
    String PROP_CONFIGURATIONS;
    Collection&lt;? extends ProjectConfiguration&gt; getConfigurations();
    ProjectConfiguration getActiveConfiguration();
    void setActiveConfiguration(ProjectConfiguration) throws IllegalArgumentException, IOException;
    boolean configurationsAffectAction(String command);
    boolean hasCustomizer();
    void customize();
    void addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener);
    void removePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener);
}
public interface ProjectConfiguration {
    String getDisplayName();
}
package org.netbeans.spi.project.ui.support;
public class CommonProjectActions {
    // ...
    public static Action setProjectConfigurationAction();
}
</pre>
<p>
 Some notes:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   The <code>hasCustomizer</code> and <code>customize</code> methods were added from the original SPI.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <code>setActiveConfiguration</code> can throw meaningful exceptions, unlike in the original SPI.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <code>getConfigurations</code> is generified, unlike in the original SPI.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The use of interfaces rather than abstract classes is not expected to pose a threat to the evolution of this
   SPI. Replacement interfaces can be freely introduced since the SPI is permitted to be called only from fixed
   GUI infrastructure.
  </p>
 </li>
</ol>

<h2>Ant Project SPI Enhancements</h2>
<p>
 Two API additions in the Ant Project SPI are desirable to permit <code>j2seproject</code>’s
 <code>PropertyEvaluator</code> to reflect the active configuration accurately, without duplicating a great deal
 of subtle code already written and tested in support of
 <code>AntProjectHelper.getStandardPropertyEvaluator()</code>:
</p>
<pre>
package org.netbeans.spi.project.support.ant;
public class PropertyUtils {
    // ...
    public static PropertyProvider userPropertiesProvider(PropertyEvaluator, String, File);
    public static abstract class DelegatingPropertyProvider implements PropertyProvider {
        protected DelegatingPropertyProvider(PropertyProvider);
        protected final void setDelegate(PropertyProvider);
        public final Map getProperties();
        public final void addChangeListener(ChangeListener);
        public final void removeChangeListener(ChangeListener);
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Java SE Project Metadata</h2>
<p>
 A metadata format change is needed in <code>j2seproject</code> to load configurations.
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <code>nbproject/private/config.properties</code> stores the currently active configuration in a property
  <code>config</code>. If <code>${config}</code> is undefined, the active configuration is considered to be a
  <dfn>default</dfn> configuration.
 </li>
 <li>
  <code>nbproject/configs/<i>CONFIGNAME</i>.properties</code> signals that a configuration with the code name
  <i>CONFIGNAME</i> exists. It may optionally define a property named <code>$label</code> giving a
  human-readable display name for the configuration. Any other properties defined in the configuration are
  applied to the project when that configuration is active and override defaults in
  <code>nbproject/project.properties</code>.
 </li>
 <li>
  <code>nbproject/private/configs/<i>CONFIGNAME</i>.properties</code> is optional and can contain per-user
  settings for the indicated configuration. Any such properties override defaults in
  <code>nbproject/private/private.properties</code>.
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 There is no support for <dfn>orthogonal</dfn> configurations, for example a build configuration and a run
 configuration active simultaneously, though a configuration could hold either build-oriented or run-oriented
 properties or both. Neither Java ME nor CND projects ever apparently needed orthogonal configurations, so this
 was not considered a goal.
</p>
<p>
 There is no support for one configuration <dfn>inheriting</dfn> default settings from another, except in that
 all named configurations inherit defaults from project-wide settings. (The default configuration behaves like
 an empty configuration.)
</p>

<h1>UI Overview</h1>
<p>
 The proposed changes affect both the global and <code>j2seproject</code> GUIs.
</p>

<h2>Global UI Changes</h2>
<p>
 These UI elements are borrowed from the Java ME and CND project types with only minor modifications.
</p>
<p>
 A combo box for switching the active configuration is added to the <b>Build</b> toolbar. It is enabled iff a
 main project is set which defines a <code>ProjectConfigurationProvider</code> and lists the available
 configurations in alphabetical order. If <code>hasCustomizer()</code>, a final entry <b>Customize…</b> is added
 which if selected just invokes <code>customize()</code>.
</p>
<p>
 Main-project-specific toolbar buttons are given an extra combo-box-like dropdown menu when a main project is
 set, it has a <code>ProjectConfigurationProvider</code> with multiple configurations available,
 and <code>configurationsAffectAction</code> returns
 true for that command. The menu items correspond to available configurations; when selected, an item runs the
 project action once with that configuration in effect without changing the active configuration. Java SE
 projects enable this mode for the <b>Run Main Project</b> and <b>Debug Main Project</b> buttons.
</p>
<p>
 A menu item <b>Set Main Project Configuration</b> is also added to the <b>Build</b> menu with similar
 semantics.
</p>

<h2>Java SE Project UI Changes</h2>
<p>
 A menu item <b>Set Configuration</b> is added to the context menu of <code>j2seproject</code>s to permit the
 active configuration to be changed even if the project is not the main project. It is otherwise similar to the
 main menu item.
</p>
<p>
 The <code>j2seproject</code> always defines a <b>&lt;default&gt;</b> configuration representing project-wide
 settings, and additionally defines one configuration per entry in <code>nbproject/configs/*.properties</code>.
 (A project initially has no configurations.) The <b>Customize…</b> entry simply displays the <b>Run</b> panel
 of the project <b>Properties</b> dialog.
</p>
<p>
 This panel is modified to include a <b>Configuration</b> combo box listing available configurations (selection
 tracks the active configuration for the project). The other text fields in the panel apply to the selected
 configuration. A <b>New…</b> button prompts for a name for a new profile and adds it to the list (also
 selecting it). A <b>Delete</b> button removes the selected profile (disabled when <b>&lt;default&gt;</b> is
 selected). Properties set in the default configuration are also displayed in other configurations unless
 overridden; properties are stored in other configurations only if they <em>differ</em> from the value in the
 default configuration, in which case their corresponding labels are also displayed in boldface.
</p>

<h1>Other Possibilities</h1>
<p>
 Possible enhancements, plausible but unlikely enhancements, and open questions.
</p>

<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   Java EE project types are likely to want to define configurations, perhaps for selecting application servers
   or web browsers to test against. Since these changes would not be needed until NB 6.0, they could be deferred
   until after 5.5 work is complete, so long as nothing in the current proposal seems incompatible with the
   expected changes.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   There are no plans to use configurations in NetBeans module and suite project types.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Adding GUI support for making some or all of the remaining <code>j2seproject</code> properties
   configuration-specific would probably not be difficult if it is found to be desirable. An add-on module could
   also provide a GUI to mark certain properties as configuration-specific, though it could not integrate well
   with the existing <b>Properties</b> dialog.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   <code>j2seproject</code> could directly permit associating arguments with classes run using <b>Run File</b>.
   A third-party module exists which does just this. While simple and perhaps enough for many people, the UI is
   different from that of the “main” class in the project; other parameters (such as JVM arguments) would need
   to be handled separately; there would be no evolution path to add build or other kinds of configurations; and
   the disparity with the UI of Java ME and CND projects would remain.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Java ME projects use a somewhat different storage format for configurations. They keep all the data in
   <code>project.properties</code> and <code>private.properties</code>, but prefix configuration-specific
   property names with the prefix <code>configs.<i>CONFIGNAME</i>.</code> and use Ant filter chains to strip off
   the prefix when loading. This style also works well and avoids the need for extra properties files, although
   it is a bit trickier in <code>build-impl.xml</code> and makes it less obvious which configurations exist in a
   given project. (Configurations are listed in <code>project.xml</code> for <code>j2meproject</code>s.) Would
   an inconsistency in storage format between <code>j2seproject</code> and <code>j2meproject</code> be a
   potential problem? Would the other style be preferable for <code>j2seproject</code> for independent reasons?
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Is a public support SPI needed for configuration storage in Ant-based projects?
   <code>J2SEConfigurationProvider</code> is mostly generic, referring to <code>j2seproject</code>-specific code
   only in <code>customize()</code>, so this could easily be made into a support SPI if desired. Of course this
   question is dependent on the previous question about what storage format for configurations should be
   recommended.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Loading and storing configuration-specific settings for the <b>Properties</b> dialog is a bit complex, and
   not supported by the current <code>StoreGroup</code> SPI (cf. <code>J2SEProjectProperties</code>). Displaying
   a configuration chooser in the <b>Properties</b> dialog and marking particular properties as belonging to the
   currently selected configuration is also not trivial (cf. <code>CustomizerRun</code>). Assuming there were a
   conventional storage format for configurations, it would be nice to also have an extension to
   <code>StoreGroup</code> to mark certain properties as (potentially) configuration-specific, and perhaps even
   to adjust a GUI display to make the elements switch themselves according to active configuration. However it
   is not clear whether a configuration-sensitive storage SPI would be generally usable, as details of storage
   for nontrivial properties like classpaths might still require project-type-specific logic; and a
   configuration-sensitive GUI SPI could be even more difficult, especially without a standardized data binding
   framework. So these enhancements are probably best left for a future release.
