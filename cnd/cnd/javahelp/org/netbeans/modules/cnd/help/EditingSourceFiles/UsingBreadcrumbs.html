       The breadcrumbs navigation bar is located under the source editor window to show you nested
      elements relative to the cursor location. &nbsp;Each element is marked with an <a href=
      "Icons.html">icon</a> to identify its type.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To use the breadcrumbs do one of the following:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click the arrows in the breadcrumbs bar to display a list of the nested statements or
        members and select one to go there in the source editor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the items in the breadcrumbs bar to go back through the history of the cursor
        position.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press Alt+Left and Alt+Right to move backward and forward through the history of the cursor
