A.7) The JOGL source tree _may_ contain code from Oculus VR, Inc.
     which is covered by it's own permissive Oculus VR Rift SDK Software License.

    This code _can_ be included to produce a binding
    and hence support for the Oculus VR Rift.

    The code is included _and_ it's build artifacts will be released,
    if the git sub-module oculusvr-sdk is included in the jogl source repository
    as true for current official JogAmp builds and releases!

    If using JogAmp JOGL builds with oculusvr-sdk support,
    but the user prefers to _not_ use it for license or other reasons,
    the user can simply remove the artifacts 'jar/atomics/oculusvr*jar'.
    No other produced artifact is affected.

    While the Oculus VR Rift SDK Software License is permissive,
    it's differences to the New BSD license shall be mentioned, see below!
