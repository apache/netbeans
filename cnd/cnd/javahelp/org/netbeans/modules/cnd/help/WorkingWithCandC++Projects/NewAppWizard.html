<title>New C/C++ Application Wizard: Name and Location</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>New C/C++ Application Wizard: Name and Location</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>The New C/C++ Application wizard enables you to create a new C or C++
application project. The New C/C++ Qt Application wizard is similar, and
allows you to create a new C/C++ Application that uses the Qt libraries
and tools.</p>
<p>In the Name and Location page, you must set the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>Project Name.</b> Specifies the display name of the project.
This name is also used to create the project folder.
</li>
<li><b>Project Location.</b> Specifies the directory in which
the project will be created.</li>
<li><b>Project Folder.</b> Specifies the folder where you want to store the
project metadata.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also set the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>Project Makefile Name.</b> You can change the default name of the project makefile.
If a makefile already exists in the project folder, the default name is Makefile-<i>project</i>.mk; otherwise,
the default name is Makefile.</li>
<li><b>Create Main File. </b> You can change the default name of the main program file, and select the
C, C++, or Fortran language from the drop-down list.  By default the name is <tt>main</tt> and the language is C++. For Qt projects,
the language can only be C++.</li>
<li><b>Build Host.</b> You can select the local host or a remote build host
that you have previously set up. The project will be built and run on the selected build host.</li>
<li><b>Tool Collection.</b> You can select a tool collection that has been previously configured for the selected build host.
The tool collection will be used to build and run the project.</li>
