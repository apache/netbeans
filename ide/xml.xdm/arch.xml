   which to provide a model basis for graphical multi way editors.

   This module was developed to support the following requirements:
   <ul>

 <answer id="arch-usecases">
   The typical client of XDM would be a tool author supporting an XML language 
who wants to provide a custom client API. A concrete example of this is the XML 
Schema model. The XML Schema model starts by subclassing AbstractXDMModel and
providing the component updater, which is called in conjunction with sync
to mutate the model according to changes in the underlying source. 

<usecase id="uc1" name="WSDL model">
    The WSDL model is based on the XDM model and relies on the XDM capabilities
    to provide the infrastructure necessary for providing a XAM based model.
</usecase>
<usecase id="uc2" name="Schema model">
    The Schema model is based on the XDM model and relies on the XDM capabilities
    to provide the infrastructure necessary for providing a XAM based model.

<usecase id="uc3" name="BPEL model">
    The BPEL model is based on the XDM model and relies on the XDM capabilities

The XDM model can be used in standalone mode. 
<code>  <br/><br/>
        BaseDocument sd = ...;
	<br/>
        Lookup lookup = Lookups.singleton(sd);
	<br/>
	// create an editable ModelSource with base document
	<br/>
	// in the lookup (this is required)
	<br/>
	ModelSource ms = new ModelSource(lookup, true);
	<br/>
	// create an XDMModel
	<br/>
        XDMModel model = new XDMModel(ms);
	<br/>
	// sync the XDM model with the underlying source
	<br/>
        model.sync();
	<br/>
	// create customer element, same as dom
	<br/>
	Element customer = model.getDocument().createElement("customer");
	<br/>
	// add to the model as 0th child of employee element, not shown

        </question>
-->
 <answer id="arch-what">
   The XDM module provides a basis for tool ready XML language models that require full 
document fidelity, undo/redo, and the ability to sync with the underlying source.
<p>List of the main features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for full document fidelity. The users text including spacing and 
  comments are preserved.</li>
  <li>Undo / Redo is supported using the concept of an immutable tree. XDM nodes 
  do not have parent pointers (only a pointer to the model). Thus a node can
  be in multiple trees, where each tree is a version. When a mutation to the tree
  occurs a clone is made of each node in the parent path from the root to the mutated
  node. All unchanged nodes are simply referenced and thus will live in multiple
  trees. Thus an undo / redo is simply a reference change. The cost of storing
  multiple tree is minimized as only the diffs are stored in each version of the
  tree.</li>
  <li>The visitor pattern is used in addition to the DOM interfaces which allows 
  easier tree walking</li>
  <li>An XML diff visitor supports XML difference. Element identity can be 
  supplied by the client.</li>
</ul>

            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number

            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to

            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to?
            <hint>
                If your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
                Also describe when any events are fired: synchronously, asynchronously, etc.

 <answer id="exec-threading">
  <p>
   This model has been synchronized for thread safety. Thread safety is supported
   by allowing only a single model mutation (using java synchronized keyword). The
   immutable nature of the model only requires synchronization when updating the
   tree thus synchronization of nodes which are not yet in the tree is not thread
   safe.
