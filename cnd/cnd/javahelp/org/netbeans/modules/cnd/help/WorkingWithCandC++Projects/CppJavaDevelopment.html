    <h2>
       Mixed Development of Native and Java Applications
    </h2>
    <p>
       The IDE&nbsp;can help you integrate C/C++ projects with Java projects that use&nbsp;Java
      Native Interface (JNI) and Java Native Access (JNA) technologies. &nbsp;These are
      technologies that enable you to call native C and C++&nbsp;programs from Java programs.
    </p>
    <p>
       For information about using JNI, see <a href="WorkingWithJNI.html">Working with JNI in Mixed
      Development Projects</a>. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
       For information about using JNA, see <a href="WorkingWithJNA.html">Working with JNA in Mixed
      Development Projects</a>.
