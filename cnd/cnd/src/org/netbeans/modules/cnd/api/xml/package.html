Overview of XML package.
<pre>

<h2>Terms</h2>
codec	Abbreviation for Coder/Decoder
terminal node	
	A XML node of the form
		&lt;tag&gt;content&lt;/tag&gt;

<h2>Goals</h2>
R1 XML writing utility.
   SAX parses but there's no utiltity to help with indentation, attributes,
   escaping and XML document headers and footers.

R2 codec to be separate from actual object.
   Alternative schemes involve serializable objects to implement
   a particular codec interface.
   Separate codecs are good for these reasons:
   - Allows us to write codecs for classes which we can't modify.
   - Decoding typically benefits from class extension. But extending a decoder
     class might conflict with the object classes existing inheritance.
     Sure, one can use interfaces and then create "Support" classes to be
     delagated to, but that becomes increasingly inconvenient.

R3 codecs to not be associated with documents.
   We might have an XML document which contains &lt;breakpoints&gt; at the top level.
   Some other day we might want to embed the &lt;breakpoints&gt; as part of
   &lt;profile&gt; in another document. 
   The &lt;breakpoints&gt; codec should not have to know about whether it's in
   a document or where it is embedded.

R4 Single codec class
   Not have to write a separate class for encoding and another for decoding.
   This will allow the encapsulation of all XML-specific codecing, primarily
   tag and attribute names, info in one class.
   
R* tags to driver object construction [ tentative ]

<h2>Motivational history</h2>
- While developing SunStudio we found that we often migrated where colelctions
  of data are stored (both in mmeory and under persistence) and adapting to
  distinct XML persistence infrastructures was a PIB.
  From this we get R3.

- The cnd makeproject introduced the notion of dispatching the parsing and
  writing of sub-systems to ... the sub-systems via the so-called 
  ConfigurationAuxObject interface. But this mechanism was hard-coded in 
  ConfigurationDescriptorHelper and no-one else could benefit from it.
  That implementation was a first-approximation solution to R3 and
  in this package we generalize it.

- A large amount of copy-pasted code, especially in the area of writing out
  XML, would drop various features:
  - Proper XML encoding attribute (sometimes it needs to be other than "UTF-8".
  - Inconsistent quoting. Attribute value quoting, via XMLUtil.toAttributeValue
    was used only in some places. Content coding, via XMLUtil.toElementContent
    wasn't used _anywhere_.
  - Lot of code relied on converting to XML strings before passing them on to
    other places. Having Codecs just write to a stream is more efficient.

</pre>
<h2>Example</h2>
In the following example Methods with empty definitions are elided for
brevity although in actual code they need to be implemented to 
satisfy interfaces.

Consider data which would be stored as follows:
<pre>
	&lt;family&gt;
		&lt;father&gt;
			&lt;person firstName="X"
				lastName="L"
				gender="M"/&gt;
		&lt;/father&gt;
		&lt;mother&gt;
			&lt;person firstName="Y"
				lastName="L"
				gender="F"/&gt;
		&lt;/mother&gt;
		&lt;children&gt;
			&lt;person firstName="Z"
				lastName="L"
				gender="M"/&gt;
		&lt;/children&gt;
	&lt;/family&gt;
</pre>
based on
<pre>
	class Family {
		Person mother;
		Person father;
		Vector&lt;Person&gt; children;
	}
</pre>
Let's see how one would write this out.
<pre>

	FamilyXMLDocWriter writer = new FamilyXMLDocWriter(family);
	writer.setIndentChars(4);	// as opposed to default of 2
	writer.write(new File("family.html");


	FamilyXMLDocWriter extends XMLDocWriter {

		FamilyXMLCodec codec;

		FamilyXMLDocWriter(Family family) {
			codec = new FamilyXMLCodec(family);
		}

		public void write(File file) {
			OutputStream os = file.<convert to OutputStream>();
			write(os);
		}


		// interface XMLEncoder
		public void encode(XMLEncoderStream xes) {
			codec.encode(xes);
		}
	}

	FamilyXMLCodec extends XMLDecoder implements XMLEncoder {

		private Family family		// being written out
		private PersonXMLCodec personCodec;
		private ChildrenXMLCodec childrenCodec;

		FamilyXMLCodec(Family family) {
			this.family = family;
			personCodec = new PersonXMLCodec();
			childrenCodec = new ChildrenXMLCodec(family.children);
		}

		// interface XMLDecoder
		protected String tag() {
			return "family"
		}

		// interface XMLEncoder
		public void encode(XMLEncoderStream xes) {
			xes.elementOpen(tag());
				xes.elementOpen("father");
					personCodec.setPerson(father);
					personCodec.encode(xes)
				xes.elementClose("father");

				xes.elementOpen("mother");
					personCodec.setPerson(mother);
					personCodec.encode(xes)
				xes.elementClose("mother");

				childrenCodec.encode(xes);
			xes.elementClose(tag());
		}
	}

	ChildrenXMLCodec extends XMLDecoder implements XMLEncoder {

		private Vector&lt;PErson&gt; children;
		private PersonXMLCodec personCodec;

		ChildrenXMLCodec(Vector&lt;Person&gt; children) {
			this.children = children;
			personCodec = new PersonXMLCodec();
		}

		// interface XMLDecoder
		protected String tag() {
			return "children"
		}

		// interface XMLEncoder
		public void encode(XMLEncoderStream xes) {
			xes.elementOpen(tag());
			for (Person p in children) {
				personCodec.setPerson(p);
				personCodec.encode(xes);
			}
			xes.elementClose(tag());
		}
	}

	PersonXMLCodec extends XMLDecoder implements XMLEncoder {

		private Person person;
		private Vector&lt;Person&gt; list;

		PersonXMLCodec(Person person {
			this.person = person;
		}

		PersonXMLCodec(Vector&lt;Person&gt; list) {
			this.list = list;
		}

		public void setPerson(Person person) {
			this.person = person;
		}

		// interface XMLDecoder
		protected String tag() {
			return "person"
		}

		// interface XMLEncoder
		public void encode(XMLEncoderStream xes) {
			AttrValuePair attrs[] = new AttrValuePair[] {
				new AttrValuePair("firstName",
						  person.firstName);
				new AttrValuePair("lastName",
						  person.lastName);
				new AttrValuePair("gender",
						  person.gender);
			}
			xes.element(tag(), attrs);
		}
	}
</pre>

Now let's see how one would read it in.
<p>
These are the same classes as above but with the encoding related code
taken out and only decoding code appearing.

<pre>
	FamilyXMLDocReader writer = new FamilyXMLDocReader(family);
	writer.write(new File("family.html");


	FamilyXMLDocReader extends XMLDocReader {

		FamilyXMLCodec codec;

		FamilyXMLDocReader(Family family) {
			codec = new FamilyXMLCodec(family);
			registerXMLDecoder(codec);
		}

		public void write(File file) {
			InputStream is = file.<convert to InputStream>();
			String what = "family"
			read(is, what);
		}
	}

	FamilyXMLCodec extends XMLDecoder implements XMLEncoder {

		private Family family
		private PersonXMLCodec personCodec;
		private ChildrenXMLCodec childrenCodec;

		FamilyXMLCodec(Family family) {
			this.family = family;

			personCodec = new PersonXMLCodec();
			registerXMLEncoder(personCodec);

			childrenCodec = new ChildrenXMLCodec(family.children);
			registerXMLEncoder(childrenCodec);
		}

		// interface XMLDecoder
		protected String tag() {
			return "family"
		}

		// interface XMLDecoder
		protected void startElement(String name, Attributes atts) {

			// personCode.start() will automatically be called when
			// <person> is seen due to the above registration.
			// Here we just ensure that we decode into the 
			// right Person instance

			if (name.equals("mother")) {
				family.mother = new Person();
				personCodec.setPerson(family.mother);
			}
			else if (name.equals("father")) {
				family.father = new Person();
				personCodec.setPerson(family.father);
			}

			// children handled by registration
		}
	}

	/**
	 * For decosing children we cheat a bit.
	 * We instantiate and register a version of PersonXMLCodec which
	 * takes a container (Vector<children>) to stuff new Persons into.
	 */
	ChildrenXMLCodec extends XMLDecoder implements XMLEncoder {

		private Vector&lt;PErson&gt; children;
		private PersonXMLCodec personCodec;

		ChildrenXMLCodec(Vector&lt;Person&gt; children) {
			this.children = children;

			personCodec = new PersonXMLCodec(children);
			registerXMLEncoder(personCodec);
		}

		// interface XMLDecoder
		protected String tag() {
			return "children"
		}
	}

	PersonXMLCodec extends XMLDecoder implements XMLEncoder {

		private Person person;
		private Vector&lt;Person&gt; list;

		PersonXMLCodec(Person person {
			this.person = person;
		}

		/**
		 * Form used when we delay setting the person to be decoded
		 * into til setPerson().
		 */
		PersonXMLCodec(Person person {
			this.person = null;
		}

		/**
		 * Form used when we create Persons, decode them and add them
		 * to 'list'
		 */
		PersonXMLCodec(Vector&lt;Person&gt; list) {
			this.list = list;
		}

		public void setPerson(Person person) {
			this.person = person;
		}

		// interface XMLDecoder
		protected String tag() {
			return "person"
		}

		// interface XMLDecoder
		protected void start(Attributes atts) {
			Person newPerson = person;
			if (!newPerson)
				newPerson = new Person();
			person.firstName = atts.getValue("firstName");
			person.familyName = atts.getValue("familyName");
			person.gender = atts.getValue("gender");
			if (list != null)
				list.add(newPerson);
		}
	}
