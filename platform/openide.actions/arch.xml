<answer id="arch-what">
<em>Actions</em> provides system of support and utility classes 
for 'actions' usage in NetBeans.
</answer>

<answer id="arch-usecases">
        First see the <a href="@TOP@/org/openide/actions/doc-files/api.html">API description</a>. Here is just
    a list of frequently asked or interesting questions slowly expanding as
    people ask them:
    
    <h3>Actions faq:</h3>
    
    <usecase id="context-action-shortcuts" name="How to define configurable Shortcut for Component based shortcut?" >
<em><b>Q:</b>
The usual Swing way of defining Actions for your component is to create an Action instance and put it into the Input and Action maps of your component.
However how to make this Action's shortcut configurable from the Tools/Keyboard Shortcuts dialog?</em>
<p>
In order for the action to show up in Keyboards Shortcut dialog you need the action defined in the 
layer file under "Actions" folder and have the shortcut defined there under "Keymaps/&lt;Profile Name&gt;" linking to your action.
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;folder name="Actions" &gt;
        &lt;folder name="Window"&gt;
            &lt;file name="org-netbeans-core-actions-PreviousViewCallbackAction.instance"/&gt;
        &lt;/folder&gt;
    &lt;/folder&gt;

    &lt;folder name="Keymaps"&gt;
        &lt;folder name="NetBeans"&gt;
            &lt;file name="S-A-Left.shadow"&gt;
                &lt;attr name="originalFile" stringvalue="Actions/Window/org-netbeans-core-actions-PreviousViewCallbackAction.instance"/&gt;
            &lt;/file&gt;
        &lt;/folder&gt;
    &lt;/folder&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The mentioned Action has to be a subclass of <code>org.openide.util.actions.CallbackSystemAction</code>. It does not necessarily has to 
perform the action, it's just a placeholder for linking the shortcut. You might want to override it's <code>getActionMapKey()</code> and give it a 
reasonable key.
</p>
<p>
The actual action that does the work in your component (preferably a simple Swing <code>javax.swing.Action</code>)
is to be put into your <code>TopComponent</code>'s <code>ActionMap</code>. The key for the <code>ActionMap</code> 
has to match the key defined in the global action's <code>getActionMapKey()</code> method.
</p>
<pre>
        getActionMap().put("PreviousViewAction", new MyPreviousTabAction());
</pre>
<p>
This way even actions from multiple <code>TopComponent</code>s with the same gesture (eg. "switch to next tab") can share the same configurable shortcut.
</p>
<p>
Note: Don't define your action's shortcut and don't put it into any of the <code>TopComponent</code>'s
<code>javax.swing.InputMap</code>. Otherwise the component would not pick up the changed shortcut from the
global context.
</p>

    </usecase>
</answer>  


<!-- Question: compat-i18n

     <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-i18n">
Yes.
</answer>



<!-- Question: compat-standards

     <question id="compat-standards">
            Does the module implements or defines any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or it deviates somehow?
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-standards">
Before the Actions was build on <code>org.openide.util.actions.SystemAction</code>, this
was recently changed that Actions supports <code>javax.swing.Action</code> which
is java API standard, and Actions will be improving towards this more and more.
</answer>



<!-- Question: compat-version

     <question id="compat-version">
            Does your module properly coexists with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read settings? Will future
            versions be able to read settings?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
Yes up to now it is supposed to be compatible with older versions.
</answer>



<!-- Question: dep-jre

     <question id="dep-jre">

            <hint>
            It is expected that if your module runs on 1.x that it will run 
            on 1.x+1 if no, state that please. Also describe here cases where
            you run different code on different versions of JRE and why.
            </hint>

            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an

<answer id="exec-component">
There are used three values (via <code>Action.getValue()</code>).
<ul>
    <li><api name="OpenIDE-Transmodal-Action" group="property" category="devel" type="export">Inidicates action can be performed
    (typicaly via shortcut) even when dialog is popped out (modal or modeless).</api></li>
    <li><api name="delegates" group="property" category="devel" type="export">Used internaly in <code>PasteAction</code> delegate action

    which actually performs paste operation).</api></li>
    <li><api name="iconBase" group="property" category="devel" type="export">Used in companion to Actions.SMALL_ICON. Because there
    is no way to specify values for other types of icons the value of "iconBase" is used
    to construct the resource names of disabled, pressed and rollover icons. The value is
    expected to contain a resource path of the normal icon. Strings "_pressed",
    "_disabled" and "_rollover" are inserted before the suffix when searching for
    the other types of icons.</api></li>
    <li><api name="noIconInMenu" group="property" category="devel" type="export"> 
    Allowed value <code>Boolean.TRUE</code>.
    Influences the display of the action in the main menu, the item will have no icon there. Works for Actions that don't define custom MenuPresenter.
    </api></li>    
    <li><api name="PreferredIconSize" group="property" category="devel" type="export">
    Used to support 24x24 icons in toolbars. If toolbar button has client property "PreferredIconSize"
    set to Integer(24) button tries to load icon with name "iconBase" + "24" eg. "cut24.gif".

    <li>
        <api name="waitFinished" group="property" category="friend" type="export">
             There is a new contract established between the caller of an action that
             allows mutual communication and possible synchronous execution even for 
             actions that by default perform their operations asynchronously. If the
             action's <code>actionPeformed</code> method is passed <code>ActionEvent</code>
             with command <q>waitFinished</q> the action shall be executed synchronously.
             The code:
             <pre>
             action.actionPerformed (new ActionEvent (this, 0, "waitFinished"))
             </pre>
             shall be executed synchronously, even if the action by default runs asynchronously.
             All asynchronous actions are asked to obey this contract, <code>CallableSystemAction</code>
             does it by default. However this contract is defined as friend one 
             and may be abandoned in future.
        </api>
    </li>
</ul>

<api name="ActionMapKeys" category="stable" group="property" type="export" >
<code>CallableSystemAction</code> uses its <code>getActionMapKey()</code> method
(usually overriden by subclasses) to get a key which is then searched in the
<code>ActionMap</code> obtained from the action's context. Other modules can
register their own action then: 
<pre>
topComponent.getActionMap ().put (theKey, new YourOwnSwingAction ());
</pre>
Here is the list of special keys:
<ul>
    <li><code>"cloneWindow"</code> - an action to be executed when a top component is to be cloned</li>
    <li><code>"closeWindow"</code> - an action when a view is about to be closed</li>
    <li><code>DefaultEditorKit.copyAction</code> - copy action handler</li>
    <li><code>DefaultEditorKit.cutAction</code> - cut action handler</li>
    <li><code>"delete"</code> - delete action handler</li>
    <li><code>DefaultEditorKit.pasteAction</code> - paste action handler</li>
    
    <!-- new since 5.8 -->
    <li><code>"jumpNext"</code> - when a next element shall be selected</li>
    <li><code>"jumpPrev"</code> - when a previous element shall be selected</li>

        </question>
-->
<answer id="perf-mem">
There is one class in VM per action. Because currently all actions are subclasses 
of <code>SystemAction</code>. 
Those kind of actions are singletons.
That older approach is getting away. There are already newer implementation
which creates short living action instances (context sensitive actions) 
when invoking popup menu. 
<br/>It should be measured how much of memory they take.
I guess the amount shouldn't be signicant.

            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example

            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered

            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task

            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
