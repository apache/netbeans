The "xml-resolver-1.2-netbeans.patch" was created in 2017 for the donation of NetBeans to the Apache Foundation.

The patch is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. See [1] for license information.

The patch is to be applied to the Apache XML Commons Resolver version 1.2 sources as downloaded from Maven Central [2]

The patch contains the modifications detailed in "readme.txt", i.e.:
  - The method "getPublicIDs()" in org/apache/xml/resolver/Catalog.java
  - The special "if" clause in org/apache/xml/resolver/CatalogManager.java#readProperties()
  - The org/apache/xml/resolver/NbCatalogManager.java new class.
  - The org/apache/xml/resolver/tools/NbCatalogResolver.java new class.

Note that for historic reasons the sources from Maven Central contain
MS-DOS/Windows line endings, so the patch also uses these line endings, that
must be preserved.
