/**
 * A hook which can be run when a project is "opened" or "closed" in the GUI.
 * <p>
 * The meaning of these terms is intentionally left vague, but typically opening
 * a project signals that the user may wish to work with it, so it would be a good
 * idea to make sure caches are up to date, etc. It is perfectly possible to load
 * and use (even run) projects which are <em>not</em> open, so any project type
 * provider using this hook cannot rely on it for basic semantics.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * XXX run with mutex read or write held?
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link #projectOpened} and {@link #projectClosed} are always called in pairs,
 * e.g. a project cannot be opened twice in a row without being closed in between.
 * Also a project left open at the end of one VM session will receive
 * {@link #projectClosed} before shutdown and (if an open project list is persisted)
 * {@link #projectOpened} sometime during the next startup.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An instance should be placed into a project's lookup to register it. (That means either
 * directly placed in the {@link org.netbeans.api.project.Project}'s lookup or 
 * in the {@link org.netbeans.spi.project.LookupProvider} instance that extends the default
 * project's Lookup, if applicable to the specific project type.)
 * All instances found in the lookup will be notified on project open and close.
 * </p>
 * @see org.netbeans.api.project.Project#getLookup
