<h1>Actions API - Advanced Toolbar Configuration</h1>

<p>The items in toolbars may actually be derived from several
sorts of instances:

<ol>

<li>An action implementing
<a href="@org-openide-util-ui@/org/openide/util/actions/Presenter.Toolbar.html"><code>Presenter.Toolbar</code></a>

<li>Any
<a href="@JDK@/java/awt/Component.html"><code>Component</code></a>.
Usually this will just be a
<a href="@JDK@/javax/swing/JToolBar.Separator.html"><code>JToolBar.Separator</code></a>,
since special widgets such as combo boxes and so on are better
given as the toolbar presenter of an action.
</ol>

<p>A toolbar as created when a folder is encountered is actually an instance
of
<a href="@org-openide-loaders@/org/openide/awt/Toolbar.html"><code>Toolbar</code></a>,
which is a subclass of
<a href="@JDK@/javax/swing/JToolBar.html"><code>JToolBar</code></a>
that is able to compose itself from the contents of a folder.
If you want to replace the whole toolbar with a special
component, you may do so. You need only provide an instance of some
subclass of <code>Component</code> (in the main toolbars folder)
rather than a subfolder.


<p>All available toolbars, whether created by the normal
folder-scanning mechanism or whether custom written, are available
using

<a href="@org-openide-loaders@/org/openide/awt/ToolbarPool.html#getToolbars--"><code>ToolbarPool.getToolbars()</code></a>.

However, at any given time not all of these are visible. All of this 
information is controlled by a

<a href="@org-openide-loaders@/org/openide/awt/ToolbarPool.Configuration.html"><code>ToolbarPool.Configuration</code></a>

object. All available configurations are listed in

<a href="@org-openide-loaders@/org/openide/awt/ToolbarPool.html#getConfigurations--"><code>ToolbarPool.getConfigurations()</code></a>,

and <code>ToolbarPool</code> also permits the current configuration
to be retrieved and set.  Please note that even though there are two
ToolbarConfiguration instances by default (Standard/Coding and Debugging)
there is no user interface for switching between them. Use 
<code>ToolbarPool.setConfiguration(String)</code> to activate a different toolbar
configuration. Users may only show/hide toolbars from the active configuration.

<p>What are these configurations and how may new ones be added?
Essentially, a configuration is just a component which displays the
toolbars it represents (it is the responsibility of the
configuration to determine which these are). To add a
new configuration, you should as usual add an instance to the main
toolbars folder, which should be a subclass of either:

<ol>

<li><code>ToolbarPool.Configuration</code> (you should implement
this interface according to your needs), which will then be used as
a configuration.

<li><code>Component</code> (but not <code>JToolBar</code>), in
which case the supplied component will be wrapped in an adapter
which provides the name and a standard popup menu, while the
display is otherwise handled by the component.

</ol>

<p>Currently, the standard toolbar configurations are a private
implementation of <code>ToolbarPool.Configuration</code> which
reads the configuration based on an XML file. The format of this
file is not specified by the Open APIs, so modules should not
attempt to modify it. (A user-level customizer for such files may
be supplied.) Rather, module authors should note that the standard
implementation lists toolbars from the pool which should be
displayed, and possibly also toolbars which should not be
displayed; any toolbar in the pool not explicitly mentioned will
just be displayed somewhere at the end of the component. So,
module-supplied toolbars will at least appear, though their exact
placing will not be customizable.
