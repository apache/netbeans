       Building a C or C++ Project

    <p>
       When you build a C or C++ project, the IDE calls the corresponding target in the project's
      makefile. The IDE executes the compiler from the project's associated tool collection to
      compile the source files as specified by the makefile target. The IDE's Output window
      displays the build command output such as make messages and compiler messages.
    </p>
    <p>
       Some of the error messages that the compiler generates are underlined. If you double-click
      an underlined message, the editor highlights the source code that caused the error.
    </p>
    <p>
       You can build the selected project and all of its related projects, or build any project
      individually.
    </p>
    <p>
       If the tools required to build the project are not in the Tool Collection specified for the
      project, the <a href="ResolveBuildTools.html">Resolve Build Tools dialog box</a> opens.
      Resolve the missing tools and click OK.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To build the selected project and its related projects:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
           Choose Run &gt; Build Project (F11).
        </p>
        <p>
           The IDE displays the build output, and any build or compilation errors, in the Output
          window. You can click any error to go to the location in the source code where the error
          occurred.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>To build an individual project and its related projects:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
           Right-click the project's node in the Projects window and choose Build.
        </p>
        <p>
           The IDE displays the build output, and any build or compilation errors, in the Output
          window. The IDE displays a progress bar in the status area at the bottom of the main
          window. You can click any error to go to the location in the source code where the error
          occurred.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>To run other targets in the makefile of a project:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the Project tab, expand the Important Files folder to see the Makefile.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right-click the Makefile and select Make Target &gt; <i>target</i>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>To stop building a project:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click the <img align="bottom" src="../images/stop.png" alt="Stop icon"> icon in the top left corner of the
        Output window.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can also click the X in the progress bar in the status area at the bottom of the IDE
        window.
