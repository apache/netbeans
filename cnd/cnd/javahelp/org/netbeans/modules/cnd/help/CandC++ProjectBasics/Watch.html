<h2>New Watch Dialog Box</h2>
<p>The New Watch dialog box lets you specify variables or expressions
to watch continuously when debugging an application. You open this
dialog box by choosing Debug > New Watch, right-clicking a
variable in the Source Editor and choosing New Watch, or
clicking the New Watch button <img src="../images/newWatch.png" alt="New Watch button">&nbsp; in
the Variables window. When you open
the dialog box from the Source Editor, the Watch Expression field
contains the name of the variable that the insertion point is on.
</p>
<p>
When you specify an expression to watch, follow the syntax rules of
the debugger that you are using, which by default is the gdb debugger.
</p>
<p>
When you create a watch, the value of the variable or expression is
immediately evaluated and displayed in the Watches window. The
value is based on the current context. When you change the current
context, the Watches window is updated to show the value of the
watch for that context.
