        * The caller will decide either to stop scanning at all
        * or to relocate scanning and provide next buffer with characters.
        * The lastBuffer variable indicates whether the scanning will
        * stop (true) or the caller will provide another buffer
        * to continue on (false) and call relocate() to continue on the given buffer.
        * If this is the last buffer, the analyzer must ensure
        * that for all internal states there will be some token ID returned.
        * The easiest way how to ensure that all the internal states will
        * be covered is to copy all the internal state constants and
        * put them after the switch() and provide the code that will return
        * appropriate token ID.
        *
        * When there are no more characters available in the buffer
        * and the buffer is not the last one the analyzer can still
        * decide to return the token ID even if it doesn't know whether
        * the token is complete or not. This is possible in this simple
        * implementation for example because it doesn't matter whether
        * it returns the text all together or broken into several pieces.
        * The advantage of such aproach is that the preScan value
        * is minimized which avoids the additional increasing of the buffer
        * by preScan characters, but on the other hand it can become
        * problematic if the token should be forwarded for some further
        * processing. For example it could seem handy to return incomplete
        * token for java block comments but it could become difficult
        * if we would want to analyzer these comment tokens additionally
        * by the HTML analyzer for example.
