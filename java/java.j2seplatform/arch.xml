            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number

            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.

-->
 <answer id="compat-version">
  <p>
   The Java platform type uses a versioned XML DTD.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is no versioning information in the class library definition (beyond
   what the Project Libraries module provides). However there are only three
   defined volume types currently, and if more need to be added, they could be,
   or existing volume types could be ignored. The current code would not be able
   to ignore volume types added in the future, however.

   Any. However some heuristics are used to find commands which are part of
   target VMs, such as the <code>java</code> launcher, or <code>javac</code>;
   normally they are searched for in the <code>bin</code> subdirectory, appending
   <code>.exe</code> on Windows, but the search locations are different on Mac OS
   X. Support for more exotic platforms would require patches to locate specific
   tools; there is no general specification for where to find JDK/JRE commands on

 <answer id="exec-process">
  <p>
   The J2SE platform wizard runs an autodetect probe to find the version number,
   system properties, and other information about a target VM. This is a simple
   prebuilt Java program run against the <code>java</code> launcher of the target
   VM. No I/O streams are used; the probe writes all information to a named
   properties file and exits. (The exit code is checked.)

            What threading models, if any, does your module adhere to?
            <hint>
                If your module calls foreign APIs which have a specific threading model,
                indicate how you comply with the requirements for multithreaded access
                (synchronization, mutexes, etc.) applicable to those APIs.
                If your module defines any APIs, or has complex internal structures
                that might be used from multiple threads, declare how you protect
                data against concurrent access, race conditions, deadlocks, etc.,
                and whether such rules are enforced by runtime warnings, errors, assertions, etc.
                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.
