/**
 * Determine whether files should be shared (for example in a VCS) or are intended

 * Could be implemented e.g. by project types which know that certain files or folders in
 * a project (e.g. <code>src/</code>) are intended for VCS sharing while others
 * (e.g. <code>build/</code>) are not.
 * </p>

 * Note that the Project API module registers a default implementation of this query
 * which delegates to the project which owns the queried file, if there is one.
 * This is more efficient than searching instances in global lookup, so use that
 * facility wherever possible.
