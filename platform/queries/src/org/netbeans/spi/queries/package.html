Permits query implementations to be registered.

<p>A query is implemented by creating an instance of its implementation
interface and registering it to default lookup. Queriers should normally not
need to see these interfaces directly since there is a matching utility class
which aggregates and prioritizes the results automatically. The utility class in
the API can also insulate clients from changes in the SPI.</p>

<p>It is expected that only a small number of implementations of a given query
interface are actually registered at once, so the critical path for answering it
should be relatively short. Where a large number of modules are
able to supply information for a query following a common structure, and it is
possible to quickly determine which one would know the answer, a multiplexing
implementation of the query interface may be registered which can reroute
requests directly to a proper implementation of some secondary interface (again
registered in default lookup). This technique permits the SPI to be very
flexible while keeping a typical API method call fast. For an example, note that
only one instance of
<a href="@org-netbeans-modules-projectapi@/org/netbeans/spi/project/ProjectFactory.html"><code>ProjectFactory</code></a>
is
necessary to support all Ant-based projects: each project type is defined using
an
<a href="@org-netbeans-modules-project-ant@/org/netbeans/spi/project/support/ant/AntBasedProjectType.html"><code>AntBasedProjectType</code></a>,
and the
singleton multiplexer delegates appropriately based on the project type ID found
in <code>nbproject/project.xml</code> in the project directory. Therefore adding
a new Ant-based project type should not increase the time required to recognize a
particular Ant-based project on disk.</p>
