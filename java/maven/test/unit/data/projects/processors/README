The 'src' directory contains sources for maven projects, that are using in the testing. 
The project were "compiled" locally and their local repository data are in 'repo'
The contents of the 'repo' directory is copied to the local maven repository during the tests,
and the (sole) directory 'nbtest' is removed from the local repo in test's tearDown().
