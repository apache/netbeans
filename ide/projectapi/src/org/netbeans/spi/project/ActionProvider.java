/**
 * Ability for a project to have various actions (e.g. Build) invoked on it.
 * Should be registered in a project's lookup and will be used by UI infrastructure.
 * <p>
 * Implementations supporting single file commands (command constants ending with
 * {@code _SINGLE}) can also be registered in default lookup. If a provider in project
 * lookup does not enable the action for a given command on the selected file then
 * the first implementation found in default lookup that is enabled will be used.
 * </p>
 * If the project supports {@link ProjectConfiguration}s, the ActionProvider implementation 
 * must check {@link ProjectConfiguration} presence in the action's context Lookup whether the caller
 * requested a specific configuration, and use it to process the requested action, if found.
