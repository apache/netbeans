<h2>New C/C++ Project With Remote Existing Sources Wizard: Build Tool</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>In the Build Tool page, you specify whether you build
your project using an existing makefile or using a makefile generated
by a configure script.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Using an existing makefile.</b> If you build your project with an existing makefile, type the
path to the makefile in the Existing Makefile text field, or click
the Browse button and select the makefile in the Select Makefile
dialog box. The <b>Clean and Build after Finish</b> option causes the IDE to run
    the project's clean and build actions immediately after creating the project.
    Deselect this option if the source folder contains non-source files such as
    built binaries that you want to keep. You can clean and build manually after you
    move the files.
</li>
<li><b>Using a makefile generated by a configure script.</b>
If you build your project with a makefile generated by a configure
script:
<ol>
<li>Select Using the makefile generated by the 'configure' script.</li>
<li>Type the path to the configure script in the Configure
Script text field, or click the Browse button and select the script in
the Select Configure Script dialog box. The configure script will be
included in the Important Files folder of your project, from which you can run it.</li>
<li>Type the arguments for the configure script in the Configure
Arguments text field.</li>
<li>If you do not want your configure script run when you exit the
wizard, deselect the Run 'configure' Script after Finish checkbox.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
