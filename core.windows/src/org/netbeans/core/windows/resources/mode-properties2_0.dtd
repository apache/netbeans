-//NetBeans//DTD Mode Properties 2.0//EN

<!-- The root element for mode properties. Consists of name, optional
     module information and several property sets for various types of
     user interface.
     Attribute "version" is versioning attribute which in fact specifies
     version of this DTD. Attribute is used to perform simple versioning
     without the need to use time-consuming xml validation using this DTD.
-->

<!-- Optional element for module information. Attribute name specifies name of
    module which defines this xml description. Module information is used for
    automatic removal of mode defined by module if module is disabled.
    If you want your module's mode to be removed automatically when
    your module is disabled, fill this element. When this element is missing,
    no automatic removal will be done.
 1) "name" code name of the module, can be either base code name or full code
    name with slash and release number. Examples for core module are: 
    "org.netbeans.core" or "org.netbeans.core/1"
 2) "spec" is specification version of the module which defines this xml description.

    "type" kind of mode "editor" or "view".

    "type" state of mode "joined" (is inside of main window) or "separated" 
    (is in its own native window separated from main window).

<!-- Frame properties.
    Relevant only for separate mode (window).
    Attribute "state" represents current state of frame.
    It is represented as bitwise mask - integer value.
    See java.awt.Frame for possible values.
    Default value is Frame.NORMAL (0).
-->

<!-- Constraints describes path of mode in model tree.
     Path consists of array of values to describe path eg. [H1;V2].
     Relevant only for mode inside desktop
-->
<!ELEMENT constraints  (path*) >
<!ATTLIST constraints

<!-- Path describe path to mode in model tree.
     "orientation" sets orientation of splitter. "horizontal" means splitting
     along x axis - components are from left to right. "vertical" means splitting
     along y axis - components are from top to bottom.
     "number" sets number of cell in given split cell. It is integer number. Number defines
     position of given cell in array of cells. It is possible to define for example
     20 for first cell and 40 for second cell. Later it is possible to insert third cell between
     first and second by using 30 for third cell. It is usefull for platform to allow third party
     modules to modify (insert) their own modes to existing layout.
     Cells are counted from left to right in case of vertical split and
     from top to bottom in case of horizontal split.
     "weight" is double number from 0 to 1. It sets relative size of cell
     in given splitter. Default value is 0.5.

<!-- Element "empty-behavior" describes behavior of mode when it is empty ie. does not contain
     any opened TopComponent.
     Attribute "permanent" can be "true" of "false". "true" means that mode remains in window
     system when it is empty ie. it does not contain any opened TopComponent. "false" means that
     mode is completely destroyed when it is empty. 
     Optional attribute, default value is "true".
     When mode is defined in module layer it is usually permanent ie. "true" is used.
