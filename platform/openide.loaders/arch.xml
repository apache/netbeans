    In summary, the <api name="LoadersAPI" group="java" type="export" category="official" url="@TOP@org/openide/loaders/doc-files/api.html" />
    is responsible for scanning files in a directory on disk, 
    weeding out irrelevant files of no interest to the IDE, 
    and grouping the rest into logical chunks, or just determining 
    what type of data each represents. It does this scanning by asking each registered 
    data loader whether or not the given file(s) should be handled. The first 
    loader to recognize a file takes ownership of it, and creates a matching data object to represent it to the rest of the IDE.

    A lot of usecases is described <a href="@TOP@/org/openide/loaders/doc-files/api.html" >in the javadoc</a>. Here 
    is the list of some faqs:
  
    <usecase id="loaders-script" name="Using Scripting and Templating Languages" >
        <p>
        Often many people require ability to create a "clever" template - e.g.
        write piece of simple text and at the time of its 
        <a href="@TOP@/org/openide/loaders/DataObject.html#createFromTemplate(org.openide.loaders.DataFolder,java.lang.String,java.util.Map)">
            processing
        </a>
        do some advanced changes to it using either 
        <a id="loaders-script">scripting or templating</a> languages.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This traditionally used to be a bit complicated task, however since 
        version 6.1 there are new interfaces 
        <api name="org.openide.loaders.CreateFromTemplateHandler" category="deprecated" group="lookup" type="export"
        url="@TOP@/org/openide/loaders/CreateFromTemplateHandler.html">
            can be registered as a services in a lookup and it is reponsible
            for handling the whole copy of the template file(s) to the destination
            folder.
        </api> and 
        <api name="org.openide.loaders.CreateFromTemplateAttributesProvider" category="deprecated" group="lookup" type="export"

            can be registered as a services in a lookup and it is reponsible

    The actions that the default folder loader shows in its popup menu are read from
    a layer folder <code>Loaders/folder/any/Actions</code>
    so if any module wishes
    to extend, hide or reorder some of them it can just register its actions there.</api> 
    As code like this does:
    <pre>

    This functionality is available since version 5.0 of the loaders module. Please use

    <p>
        In version 5.8 all the standard loaders were changed to read actions

    <usecase id="let-others-to-add-actions-to-loader" name="How to allow others to enhance actions of your loader?" >
    If you want other modules to enhance or modify actions that are visible on 
    <code>DataObject</code>s produced by your <code>DataLoader</code> and you
    are either using <code>DataNode</code> or its subclass, you can just override
    <code>protected String actionsContext()</code> method to return non-null
    location of context in layers from where to read the actions.
    <p/>
    The usual value should match <code>Loaders/mime/type/Actions</code> scheme, 
    for example java is using <code>Loaders/text/x-java/Actions</code>, but 
    the name can be arbitrary.

<!-- Question: compat-version

     <question id="compat-version">
            Does your module properly coexists with earlier and future

            versions be able to read settings?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.

            Some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules

        <p>
        Since 7.25 the <code>DataFolder.getNodeDelegate()</code> tries to prevent
        creation of <a href="@TOP@/org/openide/loaders/DataObject.html">DataObject</a>
        in AWT dispatch thread. Rather it creates dummy node with name
        derived from the name of the file and simplified content of lookup:

        ready, the initial dummy node is replaced by the real one.
        </p>
        <p>
        This whole system is slightly incompatible and may complicate creation
        of filtered views over the node hierarchy (one needs to be ready to

        the new <q>delayed</q> system by starting the system with
        <code>-Dorg.openide.loaders.FolderChildren.delayedCreation=false</code>.
        Use this property as a temporary fix for your problems, but consider

        <question id="security-grant" when="final">
            Does your code grant additional rights to some other code?
            <hint>Avoid using a class loader that adds extra
            permissions to loaded code unless really necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by
            calling AccessController.doPrivileged().</hint>

            Does your functionality require modifications to the standard policy file?
            <hint>Your code might pass control to third-party code not
            coming from trusted domains. This could be code downloaded over the
            network or code coming from libraries that are not bundled
            with NetBeans. Which permissions need to be granted to which domains?</hint>
