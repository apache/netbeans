# This file contains localized strings used in this package.  The typical
# NetBeans pattern is to use one bundle per-package, called Bundle.properties;
# the openide class NbBundle supports this usage.
#
# Typically, fetch a resource as follows:
# NbBundle.getMessage (MyClass.class, "SOME_Key");
#
# Don't bother caching strings or worse, static references to resource bundles - 
# this may seem like its faster, but it wastes memory and slows things down
# in the long run.

MSG_InnerClassAsIdClass=An inner class cannot be used as an IdClass. \
Make it a nested static class.
MSG_IdClassDoesNotOverrideEquals=The IdClass must override equals(Object o) and hashCode() method.
MSG_IdClassDoesNotOverrideHashCode=The IdClass does not override hashCode() method.
MSG_NoIdDefinedInHierarchy=There is no ID defined for this entity hierarchy.
MSG_MissingIdField=The following fields are only found in IdClass:[ {0} ]
