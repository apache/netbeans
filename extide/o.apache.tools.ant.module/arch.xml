        <p>
            The main uses of the Ant integration module are self-contained and do
            not interact directly with other modules: the user selects a target
            in an Ant script and runs it. Nonetheless, there are a few
            significant ways other modules can interact with this module:

            The Ant integration module recognizes Ant build scripts, facilitates
            editing them as text or structurally, lets the user run targets or

        <question id="compat-i18n" when="impl">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instructions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/org-openide-modules/org/openide/modules/doc-files/i18n-branding.html">

        </question>
-->
    <answer id="compat-i18n">
        <p>
            Visible strings directly represented by the module are
            internationalized. However Ant itself is not, and so messages coming
            from Ant will appear only in English.
        </p>
    </answer>



<!--
        <question id="compat-standards" when="init">
            Does the module implement or define any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or does it deviate somehow?
        </question>
-->
    <answer id="compat-standards">
        <p>
            Insofar as Ant can be considered a standard, it implements the
            standard behavior of running an Ant script. The implementation should
            behave quite similarly to what the normal Ant command-line usage does
            (since it delegates to the Ant library internally and only replaces
            the command-line wrapper with an IDE wrapper). Since the Ant project
            does not publish a formal specification of how Ant should behave,
            there is no objective criterion for judging the fidelity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likely areas of difference between command-line and IDE usage:
            obscure class loader scenarios (since the IDE must load Ant in a
            special class loader, whereas the command-line tool may do it
            differently); system properties set in the IDE but not on the command
            line; etc. Generally, well-written scripts and tasks are not affected
            by these differences, but occasionally problems arise (they are
            treated as bugs).

<!--
        <question id="compat-version" when="impl">
            Can your module coexist with earlier and future

            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.

    <answer id="compat-version">

            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and classify according to

                Context menu actions are read from the layer folder

        <question id="security-grant" when="final">
            Does your code grant addition rights to some code?
            <hint>Avoid using a classloder that adds some extra
            permissions to loaded code unless realy necessary.
            Also note that your API implementation
            can also expose unneeded permissions to enemy code by
            AccessController.doPrilileged() calls.</hint>

    <answer id="security-grant">
        <p>
            Yes, running Ant creates several class loaders to which all permissions
            are granted. A wide variety of permissions are needed by various tasks.

        <question id="security-policy" when="final">
            Does your functionality require standard policy file modification?
            <hint>Your code may pass control to third party code not
            coming from trusted domain. It covers code downloaded over
            network or code coming from libraries that are not bundled
            with NetBeans. Which permissions it needs to grant to which domain?</hint>

            No policy file modifications needed. All permissions granted.

        <question id="exec-ant-tasks" when="impl">
            Do you define or register any ant tasks that other can use?
            
            <hint>
            If you provide an ant task that users can use, you need to be very
            careful about its syntax and behaviour, as it most likely forms an
	          API for end users and as there is a lot of end users, their reaction
            when such API gets broken can be pretty strong.
