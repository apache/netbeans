<![CDATA[
You seem to have a directory named i18n/javahelp in your sources.
This probably means you forgot to pass -P to cvs checkout.
You must use -P or you will get empty directories which may cause problems.
Read your CVS manual on how to edit .cvsrc, which should look something like

cvs -z3
update -d -P
checkout -P
diff -u
rdiff -u
