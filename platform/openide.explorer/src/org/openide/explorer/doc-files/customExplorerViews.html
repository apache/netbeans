<h1 id="cust-view">Creating a new Explorer view</h1>

Anyone may create a new Explorer view and use it for special purposes
with a custom UI, to provide an alternate representation of nodes
suited to some particular application. For example, you may require
that your view only display a root node of a certain class which has
added behaviors used in display. As a rule, it is preferable to add
special functionality directly to the node if that is possible, and to
use a special Explorer view only when a truly different means of
display is required.

<p>An Explorer view may be any visual component;
it need not implement any particular interface, etc. However, the
convention is that it keep track of the Explorer manager that controls
it; this manager should be located when it is

<a href="@JDK@@JDKMODULE_JAVA_DESKTOP@/java/awt/Component.html#addNotify--">added</a>

to a parent component, by calling

<a href="../ExplorerManager.html#find-java.awt.Component-"><code>ExplorerManager.find(...)</code></a>,

and then use that manager's properties to control it; the view should
also stop consulting the manager when the component is

<a href="@JDK@@JDKMODULE_JAVA_DESKTOP@/java/awt/Component.html#removeNotify--">removed</a>

from its parent.

<p>The view will want to use a

<a href="../ExplorerManager.html#addPropertyChangeListener-java.beans.PropertyChangeListener-">property change listener</a>

to keep track of what the manager expects it to do;

possibly it could also

<a href="../ExplorerManager.html#addVetoableChangeListener-java.beans.VetoableChangeListener-">veto</a>

certain changes.

<p>Other than these requirements, nearly any visual representation is
possible, and so the API does not specify any more than this.

<h2 id="cust-treeview">Subclassing the tree views</h2>

The abstract base class

<a href="../view/TreeView.html"><code>TreeView</code></a>

may be used to create a specialized view based on the normal visual
metaphor of an expandable tree of nodes being explored. Many
customizations to it may be done by modifying the

<a href="../view/NodeTreeModel.html">model</a>

it uses to determine which nodes are to be displayed.

Or, one of its implementations may be fine-tuned:

<a href="../view/BeanTreeView.html"><code>BeanTreeView</code></a>

provides the usual Explorer view;

<a href="../view/ContextTreeView.html"><code>ContextTreeView</code></a>

provides something similar but only displaying non-leaf nodes (which
may be useful as one panel of a multi-paned UI setup, also including a
list view pane).
