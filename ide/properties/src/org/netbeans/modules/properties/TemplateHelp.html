<BODY>
Creates a resource bundle (.properties) file suitable for
internationalizing applications by separating out all human-visible
text strings from your code. Resource bundle files can also be used
to collect other types of strings, such as properties for Ant scripts.
The created resource bundle contains only one locale, but you can add
additional locales from the created file's contextual menu. The bundle
can be edited in a text file (property-file format) for a specific locale or in a table that displays
information for all locales.
