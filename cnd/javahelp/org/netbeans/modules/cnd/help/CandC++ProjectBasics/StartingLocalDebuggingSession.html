<h2>Starting a C or C++ Debugging Session
</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>When you start a debugging session, the IDE starts the
debugger in the project's associated tool collection, then runs the project inside the debugger. The IDE automatically
opens the debugger windows and prints debugger output to the Output window.
</p>
<p><b>To debug a project, do one of the following:</b></p>
<ul><li>Select the project in the Projects window and choose Debug &gt; Debug Project or click the Debug Project toolbar
button <img src="../images/Debug_Main_Project.gif" alt="Debug Project button">. The program runs until it
reaches a breakpoint or exception or until it terminates normally
</li>
<li>Right-click the project in the Projects window and choose Debug. The IDE
runs the project in the debugger until execution stops or a breakpoint is reached.
</li>
<li>Right-click the project in the Projects window and choose Step Into. The IDE
runs the project in the debugger to the first line after the main routine and
pauses execution before any changes have been made to the state of the program.
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To restart an existing debugging session:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>When your program is stopped at a breakpoint or paused, click the Restart toolbar
    button <img src="../images/Restart.gif" alt="Image of Restart button">. Restarting a debugging session throws out any cached state.
</li>
</ul>
