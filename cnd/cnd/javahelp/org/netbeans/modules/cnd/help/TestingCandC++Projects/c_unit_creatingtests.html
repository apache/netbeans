       Creating a C/C++ Unit Test

    <p>
       The C/C++ Unit test feature enables you to create test programs for use as templates for
      your unit tests. You can create unit tests for single functions and entire source files, as
      well as empty test files to be used with sources you create later.
    </p>
    <p>
       The IDE creates a Test Files logical folder when you create a project. For managed projects
      that were created with a previous version of the IDE, a Test Files folder is created when you
      add tests through the IDE. In both cases, the test files are physically stored in a
      <tt>tests</tt> directory, separate from the project's source files.
    </p>
    <p>
       For projects from existing sources:
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To create a test for a single source file:</b>

        Select the functions you want to test and click Next.
      </li>
      <li>
        Type the name of the test and the filename of the test source.
      </li>

        Click Finish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Edit the test source file for your project.
