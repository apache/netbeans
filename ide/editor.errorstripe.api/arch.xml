            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to

                Examples: a class might be non-thread-safe (like Java Collections); might
                be fully thread-safe (internal locking); might require access through a mutex
                (and may or may not automatically acquire that mutex on behalf of a client method);
                might be able to run only in the event queue; etc.

   There are not hardcoded limits. But, the number of Marks shown in the Error Stripe should be held as low
