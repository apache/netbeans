Summary of layout:

suite1 contains two modules, action-project and support/lib-project. action-project depends on lib-project. It
uses the default platform.

suite2 contains just one module, misc-project. It uses the default platform (which mentions this source dir).

suite3 contains a standalone project with a custom fake platform (a fake mini-build).

XXX this layout is largely useless for actually testing current features of apisupport/project, since it has
been refactored too many times and the test data has not kept up. Tests should probably be rewritten from
scratch to actually exercise all the possible cases, and to use dynamically generated test data rather than a
handful of static examples.
