/**
 * Entity resolver resolving all entities registered by modules.
 * Use {@link #getDefault} to get the master instance in system. Any parser working with
 * unknown XML documents should use it to avoid unnecessary Internet
 * connections.
 *
 * <p>You can register your own instances via lookup to add to the resolver pool,
 * but for reasons of performance and predictability during startup it is best to provide
 * the entity (e.g. some DTD you define) as the contents of a file in
 * the system filesystem, in the <code>/xml/entities/</code> folder, where the file path
 * beneath this folder is based on the public ID as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>US-ASCII alphanumeric characters and '_' are left as is.
 * <li>Spaces and various punctuation are converted to '_' (one per character).
 * <li>Initial '-//' is dropped.
 * <li>Final '//EN' is dropped.
 * <li>Exactly two forward slashes in a row are converted to one.
 * </ol>
 * Thus for example the public ID <code>-//NetBeans//Entity&nbsp;Mapping&nbsp;Registration&nbsp;1.0//EN</code>
 * would be looked for in the file <code>/xml/entities/NetBeans/Entity_Mapping_Registration_1_0</code>.
 * Naturally this only works if you are defining a fixed number of entities.
 * <p>It is recommended that the entity file in <code>/xml/entities/</code> also be given a file
 * attribute named <code>hint.originalPublicID</code> with a string value giving the public ID.
 * This permits {@code org.netbeans.modules.xml.catalog} to display the entry properly.
