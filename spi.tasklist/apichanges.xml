                PushTaskScanner.Callback provides information whether the framework is observed and whether the current editor scope is set.
                Both these methods are needed for performance improvements of NB PushTaskScanners.

            <p>
             Task List API and user interface has been extended to support a generic URL
             as the resource the task is associated with. This allows for example
             bug tracking issues to be displayed in Task List window.

        <description>
            <p>
             Task List implementation uses Indexing API to persist tasks created
             by FileTaskScanners. If a file hasn't changed since the last scan
             then the tasks associated with that file are loaded from cache to improve
             Task List performance. Therefore task's ActionListener isn't available when
             the task is restored from cache. Task providers must switch to PushTaskScanner
             if ActionListener is required to be available at all times.
