/**
 * This class holds and manages graph-oriented model.
 * <p>
 * In comparison with the GraphScene class, in this class the graph consists of nodes and edges. Each edge could be attach to a single source and target node.
 * <p>
 * The class is abstract and manages only data model and mapping with widgets. The graphics (widgets) has to be supplied
 * by a developer by overriding the attachNodeWidget, attachEdgeWidget, attachEdgeSourceAnchor and attachEdgeTargetAnchor abstract methods.
 * <p>
 * This class is using generics and allows you to specify type representation for nodes and edges in the graph model. Example:
 * <pre>
 * class MyGraph extends GraphScene&lt;MyNode, MyEdge&gt; { ... }
 * </pre>
 * Since the type of nodes and edges could be the same, all node and edge instances has to be unique within the whole scene.
 * <p>
 * Node and Edge should not be a Widget. It should work properly but in that case the ObjectScene class is loosing its purpose
 * because there is no need to manage a mapping of an instance to the same instance.
