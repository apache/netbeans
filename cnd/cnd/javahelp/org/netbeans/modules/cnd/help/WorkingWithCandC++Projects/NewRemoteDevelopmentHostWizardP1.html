    <p>
       The New Remote Host Setup wizard enables you to define a remote host to use with
      your projects.
    </p>
    <p>
       In the Select Host page, the wizard discovers the hosts on your network and tests their
      secure shell (SSH) connection. The table displays the hosts found and indicates
      the SSH status.
    </p>
    <ul>
<li>
       <b>Hostname</b>. Double-click the name of a host in the table to select it, or type the
      hostname you want to use in the Hostname field.
    </li>
    <li>
       <b>Port</b>. By default, ssh uses port 22. If the remote host uses a different port for ssh,
      you can type it here.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Proxy Settings</b>. The proxy settings are the same as those that you can set
        in Tools &gt; Options &gt; General. The settings are provided here for convenience if you need
        to use a proxy to access the remote server from the local host. The settings apply
        to the local host. If you need proxy settings on the remote host to access a version control system,
        such as when you want to do full remote development, you can set them in your login settings on
        the remote host.
    </li>
</ul>
