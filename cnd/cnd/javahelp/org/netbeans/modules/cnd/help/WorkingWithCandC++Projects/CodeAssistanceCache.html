       Relocating the Code Assistance Cache For Version Controlled Projects
    </h2>

    <p>
       When you create a project with existing sources the project is parsed to support the code
      assistance features of the IDE. The parsing data is saved on disk in the code assistance
      cache. Each time you open the project the IDE examines the cache and if necessary parses any
      changed or new files to update the cache.
    </p>
    <p>
       By default the IDE creates one code assistance cache for all your projects in your user
      directory. The cache in your user directory cannot be copied or shared.
    </p>
    <p>
       Parsing can be triggered when you update a project from a code repository in a version
      control system such as Subversion or Mercurial. For large projects, it can take a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
       A solution is for one developer using this version of the IDE to create a project-specific
      cache and copy it to a shared location where other developers using this version of the IDE
      can copy it to their computer. Then each developer can modify their project properties to
      reference the copied cache. After this, the parsing when you open the project is much faster.
    </p>
    <p>
       In order to use a code assistance cache copied from another computer, your computer must
      meet the following requirements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        operating system is identical to the operating system on the computer where the code was
        parsed
      </li>
      <li>
        tool collection used by the project is available at the same path on both computers
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       Note that if your team uses several different versions of operating systems and tool
      collections, you must create a different version of the cache for each combination of
      operating systems and tool collections.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To instruct the IDE to create the code assistance cache in a non-default location:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open the Files window (Window &gt; Files or Ctrl-2) and navigate to the <tt>nbproject</tt>
        directory of your project.
      </li>
      <li>
        Specify the new path for the cache by setting the cache.location property. For example, if
        you want the cache to be located in <tt>nbproject/private/cache</tt>:
        <p>
           Add the line <tt>cache.location=nbproject/private/cache</tt> to one of the following
          files:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <tt>nbproject/project.properties</tt> - if you want this cache location setting
            propagated to developer repositories
          </li>
          <li>
            <tt>nbproject/private/private.properties</tt> - if you want to keep the cache location
            setting out of version control and let developers set their own cache locations
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Save the properties file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close and reopen the project. 
        <p>
           The IDE parses the project and places the code assistance cache in
          <tt>nbproject/private/cache</tt>. For very large projects this can take a long time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        When parsing is complete, close the project and exit the IDE.
      </li>
      <li>
        Zip or tar the <tt>nbproject/private/cache</tt> to make it easier to move.
      </li>
      <li>
        Copy the zip or tar file of your <tt>nbproject/private/cache</tt> in a shared location
        where other developers can copy it. 
        <p>
           Note: It is important to exit the IDE before zipping or copying to ensure all data is
          flushed to cache.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Push your changes to the repository if you have set the property in
        <tt>nbproject/project.properties</tt>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To use a pre-generated code assistance cache:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If your computer has the same operating system and tool collection, copy the archive of the
        cache from the shared location and extract it to a location that is not in your IDE user
        directory or managed by version control. Following the example, you should copy it to the
        project's <tt>nbproject/private/cache</tt> directory.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pull the project changes from the repository.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have decided to use the private properties, add the <tt>cache.location</tt> property
        to the project's <tt>nbproject/private/private.properties</tt> file.<br>
         Following the example, you should add the line:<br>
         <tt>cache.location=nbproject/private/cache</tt>
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the project in the IDE. 
        <p>
           The IDE uses the copied code assistance cache instead of reparsing the project. If there
          are some newer files on the machine to which you copied the cache, only newer files are
          parsed.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
