<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>In the Code Assistance page, you choose how your code will be parsed to
create the configuration used by the code assistance features of the IDE.
Code assistance is a set of IDE features that help you navigate and edit source code.
    See <a href="../EditingSourceFiles/EditingSourceFiles.html">About Editing C and C++ Source Files</a>
     for more about these features.
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Automatic Configuration.</b> If the project has been
built with debug information, the IDE searches for
the include files and macro definitions for each compiled source file.
<p><b>Build log.</b> You can specify the path and file name to save the build command output.</p></li>
<li>
<b>Manual Configuration.</b> Lets you specify the location of include files and
add macro definitions to be used by the IDE to create the
configuration. The configuration will be for the entire project.
