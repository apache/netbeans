<h1>Network problem</h1>
<!--<p>
    This is the entry page to the world of statistics. The <b>UI Gestures Collector</b>
    is a portal that allows you to find new tips on how to use NetBeans,
    discover what developers using the same technologies do the most, and
    also submit feedback to the NetBeans development team.
</p>

<p>
    The basic idea is that you tell the server what you do, and the server,
    based on received data, can generate metrics, statistics, or provide
    advice directly to you on how to use the NetBeans IDE more effectively.
</p>

<p>
    You can now submit data about the UI actions you have done in the IDE.
    If you do so, the server records them and gives you some
    statistics. Right now the whole system is in development mode, so 
    we are still mostly collecting data. However, some basic information comparing
    your usage to average usage of all participants in the program shall
    nevertheless be available.

    Therefore, we cannot connect to the server to handle your submission 
    request.<br> Please verify that your network connection and proxy settings
