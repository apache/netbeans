<h2>Key C and C++ Development Concepts
</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>Before you begin developing C and C++ applications in the IDE, you should be
familiar with the following concepts:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
<li><a href="#makefiles">Makefiles</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>
Projects<a name="projects"></a></h3>
<p>
A C or C++ project is a group of C or C++ source files and associated information about
how to build and run the project. The IDE stores project information
in a project folder that includes a makefile and metadata files. Your source directories do not need to be located in the project folder.
</p>
<p>
In the IDE, you always work inside of a project. You can create projects
that use an IDE-generated makefile to build the project, or create
projects that are based on your existing makefiles.
</p>
<h3>Makefiles<a name="makefiles"></a></h3>
<p>A makefile is a file of shell commands that the <tt>make</tt> utility uses. Typically,
the <tt>make</tt> utility uses the makefile to determine which portions of a program to
compile, but there are other uses also.
</p>
<p>
The C and C++ project system is built directly on top of the <tt>make</tt> utility.
All of the project commands, like Build Project or Run Project, call targets in
the project's makefile. You can therefore build and run your C, C++, or Fortran project outside the
IDE exactly as it is built and run inside the IDE.
</p>
<p>
You do not need to know the <tt>make</tt> utility to work with the IDE. For a
C/C++ Application, Dynamic Library, or Static Library project, you can set all the basic
compilation and runtime options in the project's Project Properties dialog box
and the IDE automatically updates your makefile. If you know how to work with makefiles,
you can customize a project's makefile or write your own makefile
for your project. You can create a makefile with the Makefile wizard in the IDE.
</p>
<p>For a C/C++ Project with Existing Makefile, the makefile is not
updated when you set project properties in the IDE. To change a makefile that was
created outside the IDE, you must edit the makefile manually.
</p>
<p>If a C/C++ Project with Existing Makefile has a configure script, a qmake *.pro
    script, or CMakeLists.txt script, the script is
    run during project creation to create the makefile.  After the project
    is created, if you need to change the makefile, you can rerun the project's
    script from the command line. If you prefer to work within the IDE, you
    can reconfigure the project by right-clicking the project node and selecting
    Code Assistance &gt; Reconfigure Project...  The IDE will run the project's
script to regenerate the makefile, and do a clean build of the project.</p>
<p>If the project is a qmake or cmake project, you can edit the *.pro or CMakeLists.txt file
before reconfiguring if you want.</p>
