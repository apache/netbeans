 * and NonRecursiveFolder in its lookup. In this case the {@link NonRecursiveFolder#getFolder} has to
 * return the same {@link FileObject} as the <a href="@org-openide-loaders@/org/openide/loaders/DataObject.html#getPrimaryFile--">DataFolder#getPrimaryFile</a> method.
 * Any action which checks for the NonRecursiveFolder at all must prefer it to
 * the DataFolder since it is considered to be more specific information.
