# ${HOME} will be replaced by user home directory according to platform.
#
# Default locations of userdir and cachedir:
# (http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqWhatIsUserdir)
#
# On Windows ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with <AppData>\<AppName>, where <AppData> is the value of 
# "AppData" key in Windows Registry under
# "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders"
# and ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with the value of "<LocalAppData>\<AppName>\Cache" where "LocalAppData"
# is a key in Windows Registry under 
# "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders".
# <AppName> is the the executable's filename without the extension.
#
# On Mac ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with "~/Library/Application Support/<AppName>" and
# ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} with "~/Library/Caches/<AppName>"
# where <AppName> is the launcher script's name.
#
# On other systems ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with "${HOME}/.<AppName>" and ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} with 
# "${HOME}/.cache/<AppName>".
#
# You can also use ${HOME} variable which will be replaced with
# user.home JVM system property value. 
#
# The above location variables are valid only in the default_userdir and
# default_cachedir properties.
#
# NOTE: If you specify a non-default userdir path on command line
# (--userdir option) and don't specify a cachedir path (--cachedir option),
# cachedir will be in "<userdir>/var/cache".
#
# Cachedir must be different from userdir. The same cachedir and userdir
# would cause problems.
#

default_userdir="${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT}/dev"
default_cachedir="${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT}/dev"

# options used by the launcher by default, can be overridden by explicit
# command line switches

# default location of JDK/JRE, can be overridden by using --jdkhome <dir> switch
