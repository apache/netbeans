<h1>Javadoc</h1>
For installation of global, always-enabled actions, you do not need to use any special interfaces -
just create a <code>javax.swing.Action</code> and <a href="#adv-install">register</a> it.

Common, global actions such as Cut or Copy are to be found in the
{@link org.openide.actions org.openide.actions}
package. The base classes used to create new actions reside in
{@link org.openide.util.actions org.openide.util.actions}
(you need these only if you want to affect a global action's behavior or
provide a context-sensitive action which is disabled or enabled depending on
what is selected).

<h1>Actions API</h1>

The Actions API allows users to interact with module code, by invoking
actions via menus, toolbars or keyboard shortcuts.

<h2 id="standard">Using Standard Swing Actions</h2>
For uncomplicated cases (such as adding an always-enabled action to the main
menu or the context menu of a <code>Node</code>), it is not necessary to use
any of the Actions API classes at all - just register an instance of the action class into
the appropriate folder of the System Filesystem and it will appear.  Similarly,
any Swing action can be returned from <code>Node.getActions()</code>; it is
not necessary to subclass one of NetBeans' action classes unless there is 
specific functionality that only it can provide.
<p>
Actions are typically either presented in popup menus, or otherwise
<a href="#attach">attached</a> to a component such as a window, node,
data object, or filesystem, or installed globally in the main menu or
toolbars.

<h2 id="intro">Introduction to NetBeans' Action classes</h2>
For historical reasons, the action subclasses available in NetBeans' APIs 
are subclasses of
{@link org.openide.util.actions.SystemAction SystemAction}.
It is no longer required that you use <code>SystemAction</code> - for most purposes, 
generic Swing <code>Action</code> subclasses will work just fine.  For example, one benefit of 
using <code>SystemAction</code> is automatic handling of mnemonics - just 
place an <code>&amp;</code> character before the letter that should be the mnemonic, in 
the display name - for example, the defined display name for the Copy 
action is <code>&amp;Copy</code> - that is why <code>C</code>
is the mnemonic for it.
However you can get the same effect with any action using <code>Mnemonics.setLocalizedText</code>.
<p>
If you do use NetBeans' <code>SystemAction</code> or its subclasses, one 
important thing to note is that <code>SystemAction</code> objects should be
<em>singletons</em>, meaning that any instance of the class is
interchangeable, and all useful state should be static. For this
reason, actions are commonly specified by class name only.

<blockquote><strong>Important:
For historical reasons, by default, all <code>SystemAction</code> classes run
their <code>actionPerformed</code> method <i>off</i> the AWT event dispatch thread.  For 
backward compatibility this remains the default.  Unless you <i>really</i> want
your action run in a background thread, you should override the method 
<code>SystemAction.asynchronous()</code> to return false.  Failing to do so
can cause your action to appear to run slower than it really does,
not to mention introducing nondeterminacy.
Watch your console (or <code>var/log/messages.log</code> file) - if you forget to
override this method on some action, you will be warned when it is run.
</strong></blockquote>

<h3 id="intro-callback">Callback Actions</h3>

Some global actions should perform a different function depending on which
component has focus.  For example, Ctrl-F runs a generic &quot;Find&quot; action.
In the editor, this searches text, but in the Explorer it searches files, and so on.
<p>
To make this possible, <code>FindAction</code> is a public API; modules providing implementations
affect its behavior by setting its <i>action delegate</i> into {@link javax.swing.ActionMap ActionMap}.
<p>
The typical usage pattern for these is along the lines of:
<pre>
ActionMap actionMap = topComponent.getActionMap();
CallbackSystemAction a = SystemAction.get(SomeAction.class);
actionMap.put({@link org.openide.util.actions.CallbackSystemAction#getActionMapKey() a.getActionMapKey()}, new MyAction());
</pre>
or directly
<pre>
actionMap.put("the-key", new MyAction());
</pre>
if the key has been made publicly known and the action is not accessible.

<h3 id="intro-sense">Context-sensitive actions</h3>

Often you will want to have actions be enabled or disabled based on what
is selected.  Historically this was based on the activated <code>Node</code>;  in more
recent versions of NetBeans, this is abstracted into an instance of 
{@link org.openide.util.Lookup Lookup} (which may be the result of
the selected <code>Node</code>'s <code>getLookup()</code> method, or a merge of several
selected <code>Node</code>s' <code>Lookup</code>s).  This <code>Lookup</code> instance is found via
{@link org.openide.util.Utilities#actionsGlobalContext() Utilities.actionsGlobalContext}.
So typically, an action will be enabled or disabled depending on the presence
or absence of a given object in the global action context - which is typically
the <code>Lookup</code> of the <i>selected <code>Node</code>(s)</i> for whichever <i><code>TopComponent</code></i> has
focus.
<p>

{@link org.openide.util.actions.CookieAction CookieAction}
is a base class for context-sensitive actions in NetBeans.  Its name comes
from the historic <code>Node.Cookie</code> interface, which in earlier versions
of NetBeans was a marker interface for objects returned by <code>Node.getCookie()</code>.
A <code>CookieAction</code> may be sensitive to any object that implements <code>Node.Cookie</code>.
If you want an action sensitive to some other kind of interface in node lookup,
you <em>cannot use it</em>.
<p>
Typical usage is to subclass <code>CookieAction</code>, providing an array of
one or more classes to be returned from <code>getCookieClasses()</code>.  If the
global action context (typically the <code>Lookup</code> of the selected <code>Node</code>s
in whichever component has focus) returns non-null for all of the classes 
returned by <code>getCookieClasses()</code>, that
action should be enabled.  Override the <code>mode()</code> method to determine
the algorithm used for enablement - if all selected <code>Node</code>s must contain the
requested classes in their <code>Lookup</code> or if the presence of the classes
on any of the selected <code>Node</code>s is enough, or if the action should
be disabled if more than one <code>Node</code> is selected.

<h3 id="intro-present">Presenters</h3>
Sometimes an action needs to provide a custom component to be used in menus
or toolbars.  For example, the memory meter (enabled in development builds
of NetBeans) provides a custom component that shows the amount of memory
NetBeans is using, which, when clicked, calls <code>System.gc()</code>.
<p>
{@link org.openide.util.actions.Presenter Presenter} is an
empty interface which contains sub-interfaces <code>Presenter.Menu</code>,
<code>Presenter.Toolbar</code> and <code>Presenter.Popup</code>.  Any 
action can implement one or more of these interfaces to
provide a custom component which will be used in toolbars, popup menus or the
main menu.
<p>
The most typical use of the <code>Presenter</code>s is to return a <code>JMenu</code> instead
of a <code>JMenuItem</code>, to create a submenu.
<blockquote>
<strong>Important: Using ad-hoc Swing components in menus
is not recommended, as this interacts badly with the screen menu bar on the
Apple Macintosh, which expects all menu contents to be <code>JMenuItem</code>
or <code>JMenu</code> instances.</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="using-callback">Using <code>CallbackSystemAction</code></h2>
{@link org.openide.util.actions.CallbackSystemAction CallbackSystemAction}
makes it possible for a single action to have
multiple implementations, depending on what is selected.  A <code>CallbackSystemAction</code>
has an <code>ActionPerformer</code> that actually does the work when the user
invokes the action.  The <code>ActionPerformer</code> can be set programmatically,
for example, when a component receives focus.
<p>
<code>CallbackSystemAction</code>
may be subclassed. First decide what, if any, state the action
needs; if it does need some, this should be stored in the class
itself, rather than in the instance, as it should be a
singleton. Conventionally,
{@link org.openide.util.actions.SystemAction#getValue(java.lang.String) SystemAction.getValue(...) }
and
{@link org.openide.util.actions.SystemAction#putValue(java.lang.String,java.lang.Object) SystemAction.putValue(...) }
are used for storage.

<p>{@link org.openide.util.actions.SystemAction#getName() SystemAction.getName() },
{@link org.openide.util.actions.SystemAction#getHelpCtx() SystemAction.getHelpCtx() },
and
{@link org.openide.util.actions.SystemAction#iconResource() SystemAction.iconResource() }
should all be overridden to provide basic information about how to
display the action in its presenters.

<p>Note that you may include an ampersand in the name before a letter
to indicate a desired mnemonic position. E.g.
<samp>My&nbsp;Act&amp;ion</samp> should use the <samp>i</samp> as a
mnemonic. The default menu and popup presenters honor these mnemonics.

<p>{@link org.openide.util.actions.CallbackSystemAction#setSurviveFocusChange(boolean) CallbackSystemAction.setSurviveFocusChange(...) }
might be called in the <code>initialize</code> method if it needs to
be changed.

<p>That's it for creating the action class itself. Now another
implementation class should provide the performers for it, e.g.:

<pre>
<span class="comment">// Get the action:
</span><span class="type">MyCallbackAction</span> <span class="variable-name">action</span> = (<span class="type">MyCallbackAction</span>) SystemAction.get(MyCallbackAction.<span class="keyword">class</span>);
<span class="comment">// Some subsystem, changes in which should affect the action:
</span><span class="type">FooSystem</span> <span class="variable-name">fooSys</span>;
<span class="comment">// Attach a listener for the action's benefit:
</span>fooSys.addWidgetListener(<span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type">WidgetListener</span>() {
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">widgetAdded</span>(<span class="keyword">final</span> <span class="type">WidgetEvent</span> <span class="variable-name">ev</span>) {
        <span class="comment">// Enable it, and tell it what to act on.
</span>        action.setActionPerformer(<span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type">ActionPerformer</span>() {
            <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">performAction</span>(<span class="type">SystemAction</span> <span class="variable-name">ignore</span>) {
                ev.getWidget().doMyActionStuff();
            }
        });
    }
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">widgetRemoved</span>(<span class="type">WidgetEvent</span> <span class="variable-name">ev</span>) {
        <span class="comment">// Now disable it.
</span>        action.setActionPerformer(<span class="constant">null</span>);
    }
});
</pre>

<p>A newer style, used for actions such as Next Error and Previous Error, is not to use
<code>CallbackSystemAction</code> at all; instead, a <code>TopComponent</code> need only register an action
implementation in its <code>ActionMap</code> with a specified key, such as <code>jumpPrev</code> or
<code>jumpNext</code>. When a component with such a binding has focus (or was recently focussed), the global
command will use that component's implementation of the action.

<h2>Using <code>CookieAction</code></h2>

Using
{@link org.openide.util.actions.CookieAction CookieAction}
is fairly easy, as it assumes that the objects providing the cookies
have already done most of the hard work in providing cookie supports
and determining which objects should contain the cookies. Basic
implementation of the action is similar to that for
<code>CallbackSystemAction</code>, but now a few more methods should
be implemented, for example:

<pre>
<span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="type">MyScanAction</span> <span class="keyword">extends</span> <span class="type">CookieAction</span> {
    <span class="comment">// help context, display name, icon...
</span>    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">String</span> <span class="function-name">getName</span>() {
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">"Scan Things"</span>;
    }
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">HelpCtx</span> <span class="function-name">getHelpCtx</span>() {
        <span class="comment">// Update with real help when ready:
</span>        <span class="keyword">return</span> HelpCtx.DEFAULT_HELP;
    }
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">Class</span>[] <span class="function-name">cookieClasses</span>() {
        <span class="comment">// Which cookies is this action sensitive to?
</span>        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type">Class</span>[] {MyScanCookie.<span class="keyword">class</span>};
    }
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">int</span> <span class="function-name">mode</span>() {
        <span class="comment">// At least some of the selected nodes must have this cookie.
</span>        <span class="keyword">return</span> MODE_ANY;
    }
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">performAction</span>(<span class="type">Node</span>[] <span class="variable-name">selectedNodes</span>) {
        <span class="type">MyScanContext</span> <span class="variable-name">ctxt</span> = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type">MyScanContext</span>();
        <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="type">int</span> <span class="variable-name">i</span> = 0; i &lt; selectedNodes.length; i++) {
            <span class="type">MyScanCookie</span> <span class="variable-name">cookie</span> = (<span class="type">MyScanCookie</span>) selectedNodes[i].getCookie(MyScanCookie.<span class="keyword">class</span>);
            <span class="keyword">if</span> (cookie != <span class="constant">null</span>)
                ctxt.addScannable(cookie);
        }
        ctxt.scanAway();
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Now this action may be installed into a toolbar, for example, and
it will be enabled automatically whenever the node selection includes
at least one "scannable" object.</p>

<h3 id="install">Installation</h3>

Global installation of an action may be accomplished by
adding it to the <code>Actions</code> folder of the system filesystem,
and optionally creating links in the <code>Toolbars</code> or <code>Menu</code>
folders.
<p>
Actions only present in the popup menu of specific Nodes need no installation.
See <a href="#attach">below</a>.

<p class="nonnormative">Though not part of the Open APIs, it bears
mentioning here that the NetBeans <code>editor</code> module also has
its own action creation and installation system. These actions are
<em>not</em> based on <code>SystemAction</code>; there are based
directly on the Swing <code>Action</code> class, and are written and
registered quite differently, more along the lines of the named
actions used in editor kits in the Swing Text API. Using XML layers,
modules which use the <code>editor</code>-specific APIs may install
them into appropriate editor kits (content types). Actions may be
bound to keyboard shortcuts active only in the editor window; added to
the editor toolbar; or added to the editor's context menu. </p>

<h2 id="use-std">Using Standard Actions Found in NetBeans' APIs</h2>

Many of the commonly-used actions available in NetBeans are located in
the

{@link org.openide.actions org.openide.actions}

package.  Typically you don't subclass one of these actions - you simply
find the default instance (via <code>SystemAction.findAction()</code>and use it.

<h3 id="attach">Attaching to an Existing Object</h3>
An action that does not have global scope and sensitivity should
usually be explicitly attached to components that can use it. For
example,

<a href="@org-openide-loaders@/org/openide/loaders/DataLoader.html#actionsContext()"><code>DataLoader.actionsContext()</code></a>

may be used to provide context-menu actions appropriate to all <code>DataObject</code>s
created by that loader, e.g.:

<pre>
<span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="type">MyDataLoader</span> <span class="keyword">extends</span> <span class="type">DataLoader</span> {
    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="type">MyDataLoader</span>() {
        <span class="keyword">super</span>(<span class="string">"com.me.MyDataObject"</span>);
    }
    <span class="keyword">protected</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">actionsContext</span>() {
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">"Loaders/text/x-my-file-type/Actions"</span>;
    }
}
</pre>

<pre>
&lt;?<span class="keyword">xml</span> <span class="variable-name">version</span>=<span class="string">"1.0"</span> <span class="variable-name">encoding</span>=<span class="string">"UTF-8"</span>?&gt;
&lt;!<span class="keyword">DOCTYPE</span> <span class="type">filesystem</span> <span class="keyword">PUBLIC</span> <span class="string">"-//NetBeans//DTD Filesystem 1.1//EN"</span> <span class="string">"http://www.netbeans.org/dtds/filesystem-1_1.dtd"</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="function-name">filesystem</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Loaders"</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"text"</span>&gt;
            &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"x-my-file-type"</span>&gt;
                &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Actions"</span>&gt;
                    &lt;<span class="function-name">file</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"org-openide-actions-OpenAction.instance"</span>&gt;
                        &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"position"</span> <span class="variable-name">intvalue</span>=<span class="string">"100"</span>/&gt;
                    &lt;/<span class="function-name">file</span>&gt;
                    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- etc. --&gt;</span>
                &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
            &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
        &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
    &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">filesystem</span>&gt;
</pre>

This set of actions will then provide the context menu for the 
<code>DataObject</code>s belonging to this loader. It is the responsibility of the
loader author in this case to make sure that all of the provided
actions make sense for the object, and will run the correct code - for
example, providing <code>OpenAction</code> means that the object will have to
provide a usable

{@link org.openide.cookies.OpenCookie OpenCookie}.

<p>Some other ways that actions may be attached:

<ol>

<li><p>Nodes may attach actions by overriding

{@link org.openide.nodes.Node#getActions(boolean) Node.getActions(...)}
or
{@link org.openide.nodes.Node#getPreferredAction() Node.getPreferredAction()}.

<li><p><code>TopComponent</code>s (dockable, window-like tabs) may attach actions
by overriding
{@link org.openide.windows.TopComponent#getActions() TopComponent.getActions()}.
For example, Editor windows provide a few right-click actions in the
Editor tab, such as Save and Close.

</ol>

<h2 id="adv-install">Installation and Maintenance</h2>
Except for programmatic uses (overriding <code>Node.getActions()</code> and the
like), actions are installed via module XML layer files - by placing a JavaBean
&quot;instance&quot; of a given action class into a folder in the system 
filesystem which represents a menu or a toolbar.
For details see <a href="@org-openide-util@/org/openide/util/doc-files/api.html#instances">Working with Instances</a>.

<h3 id="install-menu">Menu installation</h3>
The main menu in NetBeans is constructed from a set of folders in the 
system filesystem.  There is a folder called <samp>Menu</samp>.  Each
child folder of it is one menu;  child folders may contain additional child
folders to represent submenus.
<p>
Typical installation of an action into a menu looks like this:
<pre>
&lt;<span class="function-name">filesystem</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Menu"</span>&gt;
        &lt;<span class="function-name">folder</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"Build"</span>&gt;
            &lt;<span class="function-name">file</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"com-me-MyAction.instance"</span>&gt;
                &lt;<span class="function-name">attr</span> <span class="variable-name">name</span>=<span class="string">"position"</span> <span class="variable-name">intvalue</span>=<span class="string">"100"</span>/&gt;
            &lt;/<span class="function-name">file</span>&gt;
        &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
    &lt;/<span class="function-name">folder</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="function-name">filesystem</span>&gt;
</pre>

You could also, if you wished, provide an object whose
instance was of type
{@link javax.swing.JMenu JMenu},
as an item in the top-level <code>Menu</code> folder if you had very
special requirements that demanded complete control over the menu at all
times.

<p>Within a subfolder representing a menu, there are four kinds of
instances which you may provide to create items in the menu:

<ol>
<li>An implementation of <code>javax.swing.Action</code> - by far the 
simplest technique, and often all that is needed - provide a file that
names the action class required, i.e. <code>com-foo-mymodule-MyAction.instance</code>.</li>

<li>An actual

{@link javax.swing.JMenuItem JMenuItem},

which will be inserted as-is; you are responsible for its
appearance and behavior.  This uses the same syntax as above, the only difference
being that it constructs a JMenu, not an Action.

<li>An action which implements

{@link org.openide.util.actions.Presenter.Menu Presenter.Menu }

In this case, the
returned <code>JMenuItem</code> will be used in the menu.
Also note that bookmarks (<samp>*.url</samp> files) as created by the User Utilities
module provide a cookie implementing this interface and so are useful things
to place in menus.</li>

<li>An instance of
{@link javax.swing.JSeparator JSeparator}, 
to separate items in the menu.</li>

</ol>

<p>Please see the class Javadoc for 

<a href="@org-openide-loaders@/org/openide/awt/MenuBar.html"><code>MenuBar</code></a>

for a precise list of what kinds of instances are permitted and how
they will be treated.</p>

<h3 id="install-toolbar">Toolbar installation</h3>

Installing items into toolbars can be done in a similar fashion to
that available for menu installation, but with more options for
customized behavior.

<p>The normal way to customize the Main Window's toolbars is to add
an item or two to one of the existing toolbars in the Main
Window. To do that, simply add your action to the appropriate
subfolder of the <samp>Toolbars</samp> folder in the System Filesystem.
Remember to specify an icon for the action.  There are options to
entirely replace a toolbar with your choice of components;  read 
about advanced Toolbar configuration <a href="toolbarsAdvanced.html">here</a>.


<h3 id="install-pool">The Global Actions Pool</h3>

The <samp>Actions/</samp> folder in the system filesystem
contains a list of standard actions, as instances in the same style
as is used for menus and toolbars.
<span class="nonnormative">
This is what is shown when a user
browses <b>Tools | Options | Advanced Options | IDE Configuration | Look and Feel | Actions</b>.
</span>
Any global
action you install should be installed into this folder, regardless of
whether it is used in a menu or toolbar.
<p>
This folder makes up the <i>global actions pool</i>.  NetBeans' UI allows
users to customize menus and toolbars - meaning that a user can delete your
action, effectively making it inaccessible.  The actions pool provides a way
to restore an action that has been deleted, so any global action should be
found here as well as in whatever toolbar or menu it is displayed in.

<h3 id="keymap">Installing Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<p>The way to install keyboard shortcuts is to make an instance of
the action in question, and place it in the <samp>Shortcuts/</samp>
folder. The file name will give the keyboard sequence, named
according to the method

{@link org.openide.util.Utilities#keyToString(javax.swing.KeyStroke) Utilities.keyToString(KeyStroke) }.

Such instances will be used to create the
global keymap used as a fallback for all components.
(Per-component keymaps can override these bindings.)
<p>
Typically, you create an instance of an <code>Action</code> in 
the Actions Pool, by defining
it in one or another subfolder of <samp>Actions</samp> in your module's layer.
Then you link to it using <samp>.shadow</samp> files from the various other
places it may be used (shadow files are similar to Unix symlinks - see 
<samp>DataShadow</samp> for more details).
<p>
A typical action installation looks like this:
